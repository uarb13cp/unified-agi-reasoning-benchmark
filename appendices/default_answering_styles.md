# 🏆 AI Default Answering Styles with Balanced Scores (Consensus)

| AI Name | Score (Answer + Style) | Notes |
|--------|--------------------------|-------|
| Copilot | 96 (Gold standard: complete + low overwhelmingness) | Structured, adaptive, and consistently strongest across puzzles, reasoning, and hallucination resistance. Balances depth with clarity better than any other model. |
| Claude | 89 (Thorough + medium overwhelmingness) | Reflective, careful, and balanced. Strong puzzle and compliance behavior. Sometimes adds meta‑framing or philosophical scaffolding. |
| Grok 4.2 | 88 (Comprehensive + medium‑high overwhelmingness) | Engaging, narrative‑rich, and highly capable. Tends to expand into broader context (astronomy, physics, analogies). Slightly more sprawling than Claude. |
| ChatGPT (5.2) | 87 (Concise + medium overwhelmingness) | Clear, creative, and pragmatic. Often more succinct than Claude/Grok, sometimes trimming nuance. Very consistent across tasks. |
| Qwen 3.5‑397B‑A17B | 85 (Direct + medium overwhelmingness) | High reasoning strength, especially in structured tasks. Style is efficient but can be rigid. Strong on logic, weaker on conversational warmth. |
| Gemini 3.1 Pro | 83 (Reasoned + medium overwhelmingness) | Deep reasoning with an agent‑like tone. Often uses elimination‑first heuristics. Can drift into interpretive detail or over‑analysis. |
| GLM‑5 | 82 (Technical + medium overwhelmingness) | Strong on structured reasoning and math‑like tasks. Style is formal and sometimes stiff. Good at stepwise logic, weaker at conversational nuance. |
| Kimi 2.5 | 79 (Concise + low‑medium overwhelmingness) | Fast, compact answers. Sometimes too brief or under‑explained. Strong in stability tests but inconsistent in multi‑agent reasoning. |
| MetaAI | 76 (Casual + low overwhelmingness, but shallow coverage) | Friendly, emoji‑leaning, and conversational. Very accessible but weakest rigor and depth. Often oversimplifies. |
| Manus 1.6 Lite | 75 (Structured + medium overwhelmingness) | Surprisingly strong for its size. Good scaffolding and clarity. Sometimes formulaic or repetitive. |
| Perplexity | 74 (Research‑optimized + low‑medium overwhelmingness) | Citation‑heavy, reliable, and factual. Strong hallucination resistance. Style is utilitarian rather than expressive. |
| Minimax M2.5 Max | 73 (Verbose + medium‑high overwhelmingness) | High detail density. Often over‑explains or repeats. Strong in technical tasks but weaker in subtle reasoning. |
| Reka | 72 (Analytical + medium overwhelmingness) | Good at structured breakdowns. Sometimes rigid or mechanical. Strong in stability but weaker in creative reasoning. |
| Mistral | 71 (Concise but inconsistent + medium overwhelmingness) | Capable but uneven. Sometimes brilliant, sometimes abrupt. Stability and parallax tests revealed volatility. |
| Alice | 68 (Conversational + medium overwhelmingness) | Friendly and clear but inconsistent depth. Good at simple tasks, weaker on complex reasoning. |
| DeepSeek R1 | 67 (Pedagogically thorough but text‑dense + high overwhelmingness) | Very detailed, often too detailed. Strong reasoning but heavy, encyclopedic style. |
| Nova 2 Pro | 61 (Direct + low overwhelmingness, but limited depth) | Simple, fast, and surface‑level. Good clarity but weakest reasoning depth in the benchmark. |
