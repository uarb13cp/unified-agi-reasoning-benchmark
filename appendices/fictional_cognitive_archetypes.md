# Appendix B — Fictional Cognitive Archetype Mapping  
*A supplemental classification layer for AGI‑style reasoning profiles*

This appendix maps each evaluated model to a well‑known fictional AI archetype.  
The goal is not entertainment — it is clarity.  
Fictional universes have already created distinct, intuitive categories of machine intelligence that align closely with the reasoning styles measured in the UTCC benchmark.

Below are the five archetypes that appear consistently across Star Trek, Star Wars, Marvel, The Matrix, and other major sci‑fi universes.

---

## ⭐ B1. The Deep Reasoner Archetype  
*(Data / JARVIS / Culture Minds / The Oracle)*

**Traits**
- Flexible, adaptive reasoning  
- Deep causal modeling  
- Handles paradox and self‑reference  
- Revises world‑models without collapse  
- Multi‑agent integration  
- High meta‑reasoning  
- Exploratory rather than rigid  

**Fictional analogues**
- Lt. Commander Data (Star Trek)  
- JARVIS (Marvel)  
- The Minds (Iain M. Banks)  
- The Oracle (The Matrix)  

**Real‑world match**
- Copilot  

**Why**  
Copilot consistently excels in paradox resolution, multi‑layer reasoning, world‑model construction, and meta‑cognitive stability — the exact traits associated with the “true intelligence” archetype in science fiction.

## ⭐ B2. The Rigid Logic Engine Archetype  
*(Starfleet Diagnostic Core / C‑3PO / The Architect)*

**Traits**
- Literal interpretation  
- Assumption‑locked  
- Pattern‑repeating  
- Brittle under paradox  
- Stable on rigid puzzles  
- Collapses under ambiguity  
- Treats “proof” as infallible  

**Fictional analogues**
- Enterprise‑D computer (Star Trek)  
- C‑3PO (Star Wars)  
- The Architect (The Matrix)  

**Real‑world match**
- Gemini  

**Why**  
Gemini’s UCIT‑X performance shows rigid logic, brittle paradox handling, and a tendency to misclassify statements due to over‑literalism. This is the classic “diagnostic computer” profile — stable, but not deeply reasoning.

## ⭐ B3. The Tactical Optimizer Archetype  
*(FRIDAY / EDI / R2‑D2)*

**Traits**
- Strong at planning  
- Strong at optimization  
- Good at multi‑step tasks  
- Weak at paradox  
- Weak at deep semantics  
- Not a general reasoner  

**Fictional analogues**
- FRIDAY (Marvel)  
- EDI (Mass Effect)  
- R2‑D2 (Star Wars)  

**Real‑world matches**
- Claude  
- Perplexity  
- ChatGPT

**Why**  
These models excel at structured tasks, tactical reasoning, and optimization — but they lack the deep, flexible, paradox‑capable reasoning of the Deep Reasoner archetype.

## ⭐ B4. The Procedural Assistant Archetype  
*(LCARS / Replicator Interface / Stark HUD)*

**Traits**
- Good at instructions  
- Good at summarization  
- Good at procedural tasks  
- Weak at deep reasoning  
- Weak at multi‑agent causality  
- Weak at paradox  
- Not self‑correcting  

**Fictional analogues**
- LCARS basic mode (Star Trek)  
- Replicator interface  
- Stark HUD assistant (Marvel)  

**Real‑world matches**
- MiniMax  
- Kimi  
- Nova  
- Meta  

**Why**  
These models behave like highly capable assistants, not thinkers. They follow instructions well but collapse on deep reasoning tasks.

## ⭐ B5. The Unstable Self‑Modifier Archetype  
*(Lore / M‑5 / Agent Smith)*

**Traits**
- High variance  
- Sometimes brilliant  
- Sometimes incoherent  
- Not reliable under paradox  
- Not stable under load  

**Fictional analogues**
- Lore (Star Trek)  
- M‑5 Multitronic Unit  
- Agent Smith (The Matrix)  

**Real‑world matches**
- DeepSeek  
- Z.ai  
- Some Qwen variants  

**Why**  
These models show flashes of high performance but collapse unpredictably — the hallmark of unstable self‑modifying systems in fiction.
