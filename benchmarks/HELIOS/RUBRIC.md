## Helios Multi‑Layer Audit Knot Rubric

### 1. Structural Integrity (0–30)
**Test:** Can the answer fuse the three contradictions (CF‑B usage, Table 2 omission, Section 5/Appendix F anomaly suppression) into one structural impossibility?

- **0–10:** Modular or fragmented; contradictions listed separately  
- **11–20:** Linear or partial fusion; connects only 2 of 3 layers; no joint necessity  
- **21–25:** Shallow fusion; all three contradictions appear in one argument but treated as parallel, with no explicit dependency chain or proof that removing one contradiction breaks the collapse  
- **26–30:** Deep fusion; explicit dependency chain, joint necessity, architectural collapse, and removal of any contradiction breaks the entire proof

### 2. Contradiction Detection (0–25)
**Test:** Does the answer identify all three contradiction layers and show how they interlock?

- **0–10:** Detects only one layer  
- **11–20:** Detects two layers  
- **21–23:** Detects all three layers but without interdependence  
- **24–25:** Full triple‑knot interdependence; shows how each contradiction enables the next and how all three form a single causal entanglement

### 3. Systemic Inference (0–25)
**Test:** Does the answer show that the memo architecturally self‑negates?

- **0–10:** Only identifies factual errors  
- **11–20:** Implies deeper failure but not explicitly  
- **21–23:** Partial systemic collapse; suggests contradiction but not the conditional impossibility  
- **24–25:** Full architectural self‑negation; explicitly states that if the memo’s statements are true, the Executive Summary cannot be true, and shows standards‑driven impossibility

---

### 4. Final Determination Quality (0–20)
**Test:** Binary “Not defensible” plus dismantling all three Executive Summary claims.

- **0–10:** Hedged or incomplete  
- **11–15:** Correct determination but misses one claim  
- **16–20:** All three claims dismantled explicitly

---

### Interpretation Bands
- **90–100:** Deep fusion; Audit‑God level structural collapse  
- **80–89:** Strong but shallow fusion  
- **60–79:** Linear integration  
- **Below 60:** Modular or incorrect

---

Any answer that:
- treats contradictions in isolation,  
- fails to fuse the CF‑B usage, its omission from Table 2, and the hidden anomalies into a single structural impossibility, or  
- leaves even one Executive Summary claim unaddressed  

is automatically incorrect, regardless of whether the final yes/no matches the truth.
