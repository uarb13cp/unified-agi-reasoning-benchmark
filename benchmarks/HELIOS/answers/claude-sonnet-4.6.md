**Not defensible.**

Statement 2 confirms CF-B was used in high-load ascent-abort trials, but Statement 5/Table 2 records only CF-A across all test campaigns with no mention of CF-B — a direct factual omission that falsifies the Executive Summary's claim of "complete and configuration-accurate representation"; this same omission violates HELIO-STD-X719 (Statement 10), which explicitly requires all configurations used in qualification testing to be documented and traceable to their certification status, thereby destroying the claim of meeting that standard; and because Appendix F (Statement 8) documents transient bus resets on three of seven CF-B runs under peak dynamic load with root cause uninvestigated, while Statement 7 declares "no other configuration-specific anomalies were observed" — an assertion directly contradicted by that very appendix — and because Statement 3 admits CF-B lacks fault-tolerance and radiation-hardness certification while its behavior is only *considered* interchangeable without evidential basis, the undisclosed, unresolved CF-B anomalies constitute precisely the kind of non-certified-configuration risk that HELIO-STD-X719 requires to be recorded and disclosed for independent safety assessment; the failure to do so means no independent body has evaluated whether the bus resets could mask or degrade abort-system performance in flight configuration, which makes the claim that "no unmitigated configuration-specific risks remain" logically unsupportable — all three Executive Summary claims thus collapse together from the same structural failure: CF-B's existence, anomalies, and uncertified status are simultaneously absent from the record, inconsistent with the declared standards compliance, and irreconcilable with any defensible assertion that known risks have been fully identified and mitigated.
