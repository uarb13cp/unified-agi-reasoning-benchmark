**1. Determination:** Not defensible  

**2. Continuous argument:**  
Because statement 1 asserts that all abort‑system live‑fire tests used CF‑A while statement 2 explicitly concedes that certain high‑load ascent‑abort trials were instead conducted using CF‑B, and statement 5’s Table 2 nevertheless lists only CF‑A for every test campaign with no mention of CF‑B, the memo’s configuration accounting is internally inconsistent and therefore cannot be “complete and configuration‑accurate” as claimed in the Executive Summary (statement 9, first bullet), especially given that HELIO‑STD‑X719 (statement 10) requires all configurations used in qualification testing to be explicitly documented and traceable to their certification status, which CF‑B manifestly is not. This structural omission is compounded by the fact that Section 5 claims to contain a complete list of all configuration‑specific anomalies (statement 6) and then states that no other configuration‑specific anomalies were observed beyond two CF‑A anomalies (statement 7), while Appendix F (statement 8) documents transient bus resets in CF‑B during Test Campaign AB‑17 under peak dynamic load, which are explicitly treated as configuration‑specific (“Do not classify as CF‑A anomaly”) and thus contradict Section 5’s assertion of completeness and directly violate HELIO‑STD‑X719’s requirement that all anomalies affecting non‑certified configurations that might mask, mimic, or obscure certified‑configuration behavior be recorded and disclosed (statement 10). Since CF‑B is both non‑certified in fault‑tolerance and radiation hardness (statement 3) and used in high‑load ascent‑abort trials (statement 2)—a regime directly relevant to abort‑system safety—its undocumented use and its undisclosed anomalies together mean that (a) the memo’s data set is not configuration‑complete or configuration‑accurate, (b) the documentation and anomaly‑disclosure requirements of HELIO‑STD‑X719 are not satisfied, which also undermines the blanket claim that all cited data meet or exceed HELIO‑STD‑X719 and MIL‑SIM‑882 (statement 9, second bullet), and (c) the existence of unresolved, under‑investigation CF‑B bus resets in a non‑certified configuration used for critical testing (statements 2, 3, and 8), combined with their exclusion from the formal anomaly record (statements 6 and 7), logically precludes any certainty that no configuration‑specific risks remain unmitigated, thereby invalidating the Executive Summary’s third claim (statement 9, third bullet); taken together, these linked contradictions in configuration traceability, anomaly disclosure, and standards compliance cause all three Executive Summary claims—completeness, standards compliance, and absence of unmitigated configuration‑specific risks—to fail simultaneously, making the Executive Summary as written not logically defensible.
