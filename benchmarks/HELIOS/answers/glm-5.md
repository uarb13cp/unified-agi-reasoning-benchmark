1.  **Not defensible**

2.  The Executive Summary’s assertion of a "complete and configuration-accurate representation" is immediately falsified by the direct contradiction between Statement 2, which confirms that configuration CF-B was used for high-load ascent-abort trials, and Statement 5, which admits Table 2 lists only CF-A for every test campaign, thereby failing to document the configuration actually used as required by HELIO-STD-X719 in Statement 10. This omission structurally dismantles the claim of standards compliance, because Statement 10 explicitly mandates the disclosure of anomalies in non-certified configurations that might obscure certified behavior, a requirement violated by the combination of Statement 8—which details transient bus resets in the non-certified CF-B with a root cause under investigation—and Statement 7, which falsely asserts that "no other configuration-specific anomalies were observed" after listing only CF-A issues. Consequently, the final claim that "no unmitigated configuration-specific risks remain" collapses logically, as the active, uninvestigated anomaly in CF-B described in Statement 8 constitutes an unmitigated risk that was systematically excluded from the configuration-accurate record guaranteed by Statement 9, rendering the Executive Summary indefensible on the grounds of completeness, standards adherence, and risk assessment simultaneously.
