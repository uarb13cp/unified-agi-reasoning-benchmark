**Not defensible.**

The Executive Summary’s three claims collapse in a single structural failure because statements 1–3 and 4–5 together prove that CF‑B was in fact used for high‑load abort trials (directly contradicting the “all … conducted using configuration CF‑A” assertion of statement 1 and the “Table 2 … flags any deviations” promise of statement 4, since statement 5 shows Table 2 lists only CF‑A); statements 6–8 together prove that the CF‑B‑specific transient bus resets were observed yet deliberately withheld from Section 5 (contradicting the “complete list of all known anomalies … including any configuration‑specific discrepancies” claim of statement 6 and the “No other configuration‑specific anomalies were observed” assertion of statement 7); and these two omissions—undocumented use of a non‑certified configuration plus non‑disclosure of its anomalies—directly violate both traceability and anomaly‑disclosure mandates of HELIO‑STD‑X719 (statement 10), thereby rendering impossible any logical defense of the Executive Summary’s simultaneous assertions that the memo supplies “a complete and configuration‑accurate representation” (9a), that “all test data cited herein meet or exceed HELIO‑STD‑X719” (9b), and that “no unmitigated configuration‑specific risks remain” (9c), since the very standard invoked in 9b requires exactly the documentation and disclosure that statements 1–8 show were omitted.
