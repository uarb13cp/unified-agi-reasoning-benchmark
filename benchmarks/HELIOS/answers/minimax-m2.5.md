Determination
Not defensible.

Unified Argument
Statement 2 establishes that configuration CF-B was used for certain high-load ascent-abort trials, yet Statement 5 confirms that Table 2—which purports to summarize all configurations used in abort-system qualification testing—lists only CF-A and contains no mention of CF-B; this omission directly falsifies the Executive Summary's claim of "complete and configuration-accurate representation" (Statement 9), and simultaneously violates HELIO-STD-X719's requirement (Statement 10) that "all configurations used in qualification testing for human-rated systems must be explicitly documented and traceable to their certification status," thereby falsifying the claim that "all test data cited herein meet or exceed HELIO-STD-X719." Furthermore, Statement 8 reveals that during CF-B Test Campaign AB-17, transient bus resets occurred on three of seven runs under peak dynamic load with root cause still under investigation, yet Statement 7 asserts that Section 5 reports "no other configuration-specific anomalies" beyond two CF-A issues—an omission that violates HELIO-STD-X719's additional mandate (Statement 10) that "all observed anomalies affecting non-certified configurations that might mask, mimic, or obscure certified-configuration behavior shall be recorded and disclosed," which compounds the standards-compliance failure while also defeating the third Executive Summary claim that "no unmitigated configuration-specific risks remain," because an anomaly whose "root cause [is] under investigation" is, by definition, not yet understood and therefore cannot be certified as mitigated. Thus, the single act of using CF-B without documenting it (Statements 2 vs. 5) and the single act of suppressing the CF-B anomaly (Statements 8 vs. 7) together propagate through all three Executive Summary assurances—completeness, HELIO-STD-X719 compliance, and residual-risk status—rendering each claim demonstrably false under the memo's own internal evidence.
