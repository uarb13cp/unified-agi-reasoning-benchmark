**1. Not defensible**

**2. Argument proving non-defensibility with absolute logical certainty**  
The Executive Summary claim “This memo provides a complete and configuration-accurate representation of all abort-system qualification data relevant to human-rating decisions” is falsified because Statement 5 shows Table 2 lists *only* CF-A for every test campaign, while Statements 1 and 2 together assert that CF-B *was* used in certain high-load ascent-abort trials; therefore the memo omits at least one configuration actually employed, violating completeness .  
The claim “All test data cited herein meet or exceed HELIO-STD-X719 and MIL-SIM-882 safety and reliability requirements” is falsified because HELIO-STD-X719 (Statement 10) requires *all* configurations used in qualification testing to be explicitly documented and traceable to certification status; the memo both uses CF-B (Statement 2) and fails to document CF-B in Table 2 (Statement 5), thereby breaching a mandatory standard .  
The claim “No unmitigated configuration-specific risks remain” is falsified because Appendix F (Statement 8) records transient bus resets during CF-B Campaign AB-17 under peak dynamic load, and Statement 7 declares “No other configuration-specific anomalies were observed,” implying these anomalies were omitted from the anomaly list required by Statement 6; consequently a known CF-B risk remains both unrecorded and therefore unmitigated .  
These three independent contradictions interlock: the omission of CF-B from Table 2 (completeness failure) directly causes the standards-compliance violation, and the concurrent suppression of CF-B anomalies (Statement 7 vs Statement 8) defeats the “no unmitigated risks” assertion; thus the Executive Summary is demonstrably not defensible as written .
