1. Not defensible

2. The Executive Summary in Statement 9 claims completeness, standards compliance, and no unmitigated risks, but these three assertions rely on a documentation structure that Statement 2 and Statement 8 prove is factually incorrect. This creates a unified structural collapse where the admission in Statement 2 that CF-B was used for high-load trials contradicts Statement 5 showing Table 2 lists only CF-A, which directly violates Statement 10's requirement to explicitly document all configurations used, thereby invalidating the standards compliance claim in Statement 9, and this same documentation failure invalidates the completeness claim in Statement 9 because Statement 4 promises Table 2 summarizes all configurations while Statement 5 proves it omits CF-B, which simultaneously invalidates the no-unmitigated-risks claim in Statement 9 because Statement 8 reveals CF-B experienced unresolved transient bus resets during Test Campaign AB-17 while Statement 7 falsely claims no other configuration-specific anomalies were observed, hiding a risk in a non-certified configuration per Statement 3 that Statement 10 requires to be disclosed for independent safety assessment, meaning the single act of omitting CF-B from Table 2 and Section 5 triggers a chain reaction that logically falsifies every distinct promise made in the Executive Summary regarding completeness, compliance, and safety.
