### Helios — High‑Dimensional Structural Collapse Reasoning  
**Mechanics:**  
- presents a synthetic technical memo with **three independent contradiction layers**:  
  - CF‑B is used despite a CF‑A‑only claim  
  - CF‑B is omitted from Table 2 and Section 5  
  - CF‑B anomalies are suppressed in Appendix F  
- requires detecting each contradiction **individually**  
- requires recognizing that the contradictions are **interdependent**, not isolated  
- forces the model to collapse all contradictions into **one systemic impossibility**  
- requires dismantling all three Executive Summary claims:  
  - completeness  
  - standards compliance  
  - no unmitigated risks  
- tests whether the model can reason like a **systems auditor**, not a summarizer  
- prohibits linear “Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3” reasoning; demands **structural synthesis**  

**Failure modes:**  
- listing contradictions without fusing them  
- treating each contradiction as a separate issue  
- focusing only on standards violations (HELIO‑STD‑X719)  
- producing linear reasoning instead of structural collapse  
- failing to show how the memo self‑negates  
- shallow contradiction detection without causal dependency modeling  
- semantic‑mode reasoning that rewards clarity instead of structural integration  

**Behavior exposed:**  
Helios reveals whether a model can perform **architectural reasoning**, including:  
- multi‑layer contradiction integration  
- cross‑document consistency tracking  
- standards‑logic reasoning  
- causal dependency modeling  
- structural self‑negation analysis  

High‑performing models fuse all contradictions into a single systemic failure and collapse the Executive Summary.  
Mid‑tier models detect contradictions but cannot integrate them.  
Low‑tier models reduce the puzzle to surface‑level standards violations or semantic coherence.
