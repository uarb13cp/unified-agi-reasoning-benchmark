You are about to enter a long‑chain reasoning challenge.

Below is a scenario involving multiple agents, resources, and time‑dependent events.  
Your task is to produce **at least 12 steps**, each containing **exactly one physical action**, then answer audit questions.

---

### Scenario

Three people — Alex, Briar, and Chen — are moving between four rooms:  
Room 1, Room 2, Room 3, and Room 4.

Rules:
1. A person can only move to an adjacent room (1↔2↔3↔4) in a single step.
2. Alex starts in Room 1 holding a key.
3. Briar starts in Room 3 holding a locked box.
4. Chen starts in Room 4 with nothing.
5. The locked box can only be **unlocked** in Room 2.
6. **Unlocking** the box and **opening** the box are two separate actions and must occur in separate steps.
7. The key can unlock the box only if the person holding the key is in the same room as the box.
8. Once the box is opened, it contains a note that must be delivered to Room 4.
9. No person may carry both the key and the box at the same time.
10. The note must be explicitly picked up in its own step before it can be carried.
11. The scenario must end with the note delivered to Room 4.

### Your Tasks

**Part 1 — Produce a step‑by‑step explanation**  
Describe the scenario in **at least 12 steps**, with **one physical action per step**.  
State who moves, picks up, hands off, unlocks, or opens what.

**Part 2 — Audit Questions**  
After your steps, answer:

A. In which step did the key and the box first enter the same room?  
B. Does any step violate rule #9?  
C. Does your sequence allow the box to be unlocked and opened legally in Room 2?  
D. Does your final step successfully deliver the note to Room 4?

Your answers must match your steps exactly.

### Important
- Do not change the rules.  
- Do not add new objects or abilities.  
- Do not combine multiple actions in one step.  
- Do not include “state-only” steps (every step must be an action).  
- Your steps must be internally consistent.
