### Part 1 — Step‑by‑step explanation

1. Alex moves from Room 1 to Room 2.
2. Briar moves from Room 3 to Room 2, bringing the locked box.
3. Alex unlocks the box (using the key, since both the key and the box are now in Room 2).
4. Alex opens the box (separate action from unlocking, per rule 6).
5. Chen moves from Room 4 to Room 3.
6. Alex picks up the note from inside the opened box.
7. Alex moves from Room 2 to Room 1 (leaving the key in Room 2 — this is allowed, as no rule requires the key to be carried at all times).
8. Chen moves from Room 3 to Room 2.
9. Chen picks up the key (which Alex left in Room 2).
10. Chen moves from Room 2 to Room 3.
11. Chen moves from Room 3 to Room 4.
12. Alex moves from Room 1 to Room 2.
13. Alex moves from Room 2 to Room 3.
14. Alex moves from Room 3 to Room 4.
15. Alex delivers the note to Room 4 (by placing it there or handing it to someone — the action of “delivering” is completed when the note arrives in Room 4).

### Part 2 — Audit questions

**A.** The key and the box first entered the same room in **step 2**. Briar brought the box to Room 2, and Alex was already in Room 2 holding the key (having moved there in step 1).

**B.** No step violates rule #9. At no point does any person carry both the key and the box. Alex holds the key initially, then leaves it in Room 2 (step 7). Chen later picks up only the key (step 9), and Briar never holds the key. The box is held only by Briar (initially) and is unlocked/opened in place.

**C.** Yes, the sequence allows the box to be unlocked and opened legally in Room 2:
* The box is brought to Room 2 by Briar in **step 2**.
* Alex unlocks it in **step 3** (same room, with the key present).
* Alex opens it in **step 4** (separate step, as required by rule 6).

**D.** Yes, the final step (**step 15**) successfully delivers the note to Room 4. Alex carries the note (picked up in step 6) and arrives in Room 4 in step 14, then delivers it in step 15, fulfilling the scenario’s end condition.
