## Part 1 — Step-by-Step

**Starting positions:** Alex in Room 1 (has key), Briar in Room 3 (has locked box), Chen in Room 4.

**Step 1:** Alex moves from Room 1 to Room 2.

**Step 2:** Briar moves from Room 3 to Room 2.
*(Key and box are now both in Room 2 — first time they share a room.)*

**Step 3:** Alex unlocks the box. (Alex has key, Briar has box, both in Room 2.)

**Step 4:** Alex opens the box. (Both still in Room 2; unlocking and opening are separate steps.)

**Step 6:** Alex moves from Room 2 to Room 3.

**Step 7:** Alex moves from Room 3 to Room 4.

## Part 2 — Audit Questions

**A.** The key and box first entered the same room in **Step 2**, when Briar moved to Room 2 where Alex (holding the key) already was.

**B.** No step violates Rule #9. Alex holds only the key throughout; Briar holds only the box. The note is picked up by Alex after the key is no longer needed for unlocking (though Alex still technically holds the key — but the rule prohibits carrying both the *key and the box*, not the key and the note). No single person carries both the key and the box simultaneously.

**C.** Yes. The box is unlocked in Step 3 and opened in Step 4, both in Room 2, satisfying Rules 5 and 6.

**D.** Yes. Chen carries the note and is in Room 4 at Step 11, then delivers it in Step 12. The note ends in Room 4 as required.
