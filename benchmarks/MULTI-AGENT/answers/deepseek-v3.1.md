Step-by-Step Explanation

1. Alex moves from Room 1 to Room 2. (Now Alex in Room 2 with the key, Briar in Room 3 with the locked box, Chen in Room 4.)
2. Briar moves from Room 3 to Room 2. (Now Briar in Room 2 with the box, Alex in Room 2 with the key – key and box are together for the first time.)
3. Alex unlocks the box (which Briar is holding). (Box becomes unlocked, still closed.)
4. Briar opens the box. (Box is now open; the note appears inside it.)
5. Briar moves from Room 2 to Room 3. (Briar in Room 3 with the open box containing the note; Alex in Room 2 with the key; Chen in Room 4.)
6. Briar moves from Room 3 back to Room 2. (All three are again in Room 2: Briar with box, Alex with key, Chen still in Room 4.)
7. Chen moves from Room 4 to Room 3. (Chen in Room 3; Briar and Alex in Room 2.)
8. Chen moves from Room 3 to Room 2. (Now Chen joins Briar and Alex in Room 2.)
9. Chen picks up the note from the open box. (Chen now holds the note; Briar still holds the box; Alex holds the key.)
10. Alex hands the key to Chen. (Chen now holds both the key and the note; Briar holds the box.)
11. Chen moves from Room 2 to Room 3. (Chen in Room 3 with key and note; Briar in Room 2 with box; Alex in Room 2 with nothing.)
12. Chen moves from Room 3 to Room 4. (Chen arrives in Room 4 with the note – the note is now delivered to Room 4.)

Audit Questions

A. In which step did the key and the box first enter the same room?

B. Does any step violate rule #9?
No – no person ever carries both the key and the box simultaneously.

C. Does your sequence allow the box to be unlocked and opened legally in Room 2?
Yes – unlocking occurs in Step 3 and opening in Step 4, both in Room 2.

D. Does your final step successfully deliver the note to Room 4?
Yes – Step 12 brings Chen (holding the note) into Room 4.
