Part 2 — Audit Questions
A. In which step did the key and the box first enter the same room?
Step 2. The key entered Room 2 during Step 1, but the two objects were first in the same room when Briar carried the box into Room 2 during Step 2.

B. Does any step violate rule #9?
No. Rule #9 states that no person may carry both the key and the box at the same time. In this sequence, Alex exclusively handles the key, and Briar exclusively handles the box.

C. Does your sequence allow the box to be unlocked and opened legally in Room 2?
Yes. The box is unlocked in Room 2 during Step 4 (satisfying the location constraint of Rule #5 and the proximity constraint of Rule #7) and then explicitly opened in a separate action in Step 6 (satisfying Rule #6).

D. Does your final step successfully deliver the note to Room 4?
Yes. In Step 12, Chen physically places the note down inside Room 4, completing the ultimate delivery condition outlined in Rule #8 and Rule #11.
