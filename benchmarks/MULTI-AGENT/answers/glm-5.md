### Part 2 — Audit Questions

**A. In which step did the key and the box first enter the same room?**
Step 2. (Alex entered Room 2 in Step 1, but the box did not enter Room 2 until Briar moved there in Step 2.)

**B. Does any step violate rule #9?**
No. Alex holds the key throughout the scenario, and Briar holds the box until she puts it down. No person ever holds both the key and the box simultaneously.

**C. Does your sequence allow the box to be unlocked and opened legally in Room 2?**
Yes. Both actions occur in Room 2 (Step 5 and Step 6), the key holder (Alex) is in the same room as the box, and the actions are performed in separate steps.

**D. Does your final step successfully deliver the note to Room 4?**
Yes. In Step 12, Chen explicitly places the note in Room 4.
