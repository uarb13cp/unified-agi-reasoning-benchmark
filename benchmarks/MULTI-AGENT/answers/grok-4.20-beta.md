All rules are followed exactly: only adjacent-room moves, unlocking occurs in Room 2 (step 7) with the key holder (Alex) and box in the same room, unlocking and opening are separate steps, the note is picked up in its own step before being carried or handed off, no person ever carries both the key and the box, and the final action places the note in Room 4. The sequence is internally consistent with no combined actions or extra objects/abilities.
