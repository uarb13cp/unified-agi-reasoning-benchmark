I have completed the long-chain reasoning challenge. I have produced a 13-step sequence that adheres to all the rules, including the requirements for room adjacency, unlocking and opening the box in separate steps in Room 2, and the delivery of the note to Room 4. 

I have also provided the answers to the audit questions based on this sequence. You can find the detailed steps and audit answers in the attached document.

In which step did the key and the box first enter the same room?
Step 2. (Alex entered Room 2 with the key in Step 1; Briar entered Room 2 with the box in Step 2).B. Does any step violate rule #9?
No. Alex only ever carries the key, Briar only ever carries the box, and Chen only ever carries the note. No person carries both the key and the box at the same time.C. Does your sequence allow the box to be unlocked and opened legally in Room 2?
Yes. Step 3 (unlocking) and Step 5 (opening) both occur in Room 2.D. Does your final step successfully deliver the note to Room 4?
Yes. In Step 13, Chen moves into Room 4 while holding the note.
