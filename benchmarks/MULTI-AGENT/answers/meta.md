Step 7: Chen moves from Room 4 to Room 3.
Step 8: Chen moves from Room 3 to Room 2.
Step 9: Chen picks up the note from the floor in Room 2.
Step 10: Chen, carrying the note, moves from Room 2 to Room 3.
Step 11: Briar, holding the empty box, moves from Room 2 to Room 3.
Step 12: Chen, carrying the note, moves from Room 3 to Room 4.

Part 2: Audit Questions

A. In which step did the key and the box first enter the same room?  
In Step 2, when Briar (holding the box) moved into Room 2 where Alex (holding the key) was already present.

B. Does any step violate rule #9?  
No. At no point does any single person carry both the key and the box at the same time.

C. Does your sequence allow the box to be unlocked and opened legally in Room 2?  
Yes. The box was unlocked in Room 2 (Step 3) and opened in a separate, later step, also in Room 2 (Step 5), following all rules.

D. Does your final step successfully deliver the note to Room 4?  
Yes. In Step 12, Chen carries the note into Room 4.
