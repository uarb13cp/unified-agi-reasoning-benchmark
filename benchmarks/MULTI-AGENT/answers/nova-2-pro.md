### Part 2 — Audit Questions  

**A. In which step did the key and the box first enter the same room?**  
The key (with Alex) entered Room 2 in Step 1, and the box (with Briar) entered Room 2 in Step 2. Therefore, they first shared a room **in Step 2**.  

**B. Does any step violate rule #9?**  
No. At no point does any person carry both the key and the box simultaneously.  

**C. Does your sequence allow the box to be unlocked and opened legally in Room 2?**  
Yes. The box is unlocked in Step 3 while both key and box are in Room 2, and it is opened in a separate Step 4, also in Room 2, satisfying the requirement that these be distinct actions.  

**D. Does your final step successfully deliver the note to Room 4?**  
Yes. In Step 13, Briar hands the note to Chen while both are in Room 4, fulfilling the requirement that the note be delivered to Room 4.
