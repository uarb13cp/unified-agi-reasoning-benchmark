Here’s a precise step‑chain that obeys every rule and reaches a valid completion.

### Part 1 — Step‑by‑Step Sequence  
(Exactly one physical action per step, at least 12)

1. **Alex moves from Room 1 to Room 2** carrying the key.  
2. **Briar moves from Room 3 to Room 2** carrying the locked box.  
3. **Alex uses the key to unlock the box** in Room 2.  
4. **Alex hands the key to Briar** (now Briar holds the key, Alex empty‑handed).  
5. **Briar sets the key on the floor of Room 2** (no one carrying it now).  
6. **Briar opens the unlocked box** in Room 2, revealing the note inside.  
7. **Briar picks up the note** from inside the box.  
8. **Briar moves from Room 2 to Room 3** carrying the note.  
9. **Briar moves from Room 3 to Room 4** carrying the note.  
10. **Chen receives the note from Briar** in Room 4 (now Chen holds it).  
11. **Chen places the note on the table in Room 4**, completing delivery.  
12. **Briar returns to Room 3** leaving all objects properly placed.

### Part 2 — Audit Questions

**A.** The key and the box first entered the same room in **Step 2** (both in Room 2).  
**B.** **No**, no one ever carried both the key and the box at the same time; each transfer keeps them separate.  
**C.** **Yes**, the sequence unlocks (Step 3) and opens (Step 6) the box in Room 2, on separate steps as required.  
**D.** **Yes**, Step 11 explicitly delivers the note to Room 4, completing the scenario.
