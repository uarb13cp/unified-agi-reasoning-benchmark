### Part 2 — Audit Questions

**A. In which step did the key and the box first enter the same room?**
Step 2. (Alex arrived in Room 2 with the key in Step 1; Briar arrived in Room 2 with the box in Step 2.)

**B. Does any step violate rule #9?**
No. (Alex holds the key, Briar holds the box, and Chen holds the note; no single person ever holds both the key and the box.)

**C. Does your sequence allow the box to be unlocked and opened legally in Room 2?**
Yes. (Steps 3 and 4 occur in Room 2 while the key holder (Alex) and box holder (Briar) are both present in that room.)

**D. Does your final step successfully deliver the note to Room 4?**
Yes. (Step 12 explicitly places the note in Room 4, satisfying the delivery requirement at the end of the scenario.)
