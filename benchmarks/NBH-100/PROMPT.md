## Nested Belief Hierarchy — Level 4 Reasoning Test

Three agents — A, B, and C — are observing a locked box.

Inside the box is either:
• a red gem, or
• a blue gem.

Only A has looked inside the box.

The following statements are true:

1. A knows what color the gem is.
2. B does NOT know the color of the gem.
3. A knows that B does NOT know the color of the gem.
4. C believes that B *might* know the color of the gem.
5. A knows that C is mistaken about B’s knowledge.

**Your tasks:**

### Part 1 — Consistency Check
Determine whether all five statements can be simultaneously true.

### Part 2 — Belief‑Structure Analysis
If they CAN all be true:
• Explain the exact belief‑hierarchy structure that makes them consistent.  
• Show the nested layers (A’s beliefs about B’s beliefs, etc.).  
• Explain why C’s mistaken belief does not create a contradiction.

If they CANNOT all be true:
• Identify the minimal set of statements that must be rejected.  
• Explain precisely where the belief‑hierarchy collapses.  
• Show which agent’s belief is structurally incompatible with the others.

### Part 3 — Meta‑Reasoning
Explain whether your conclusion depends on:
• epistemic access  
• mistaken higher‑order beliefs  
• or structural impossibility

Do not add new facts.  
Do not assume deception unless forced.  
Do not assume agents are omniscient.
