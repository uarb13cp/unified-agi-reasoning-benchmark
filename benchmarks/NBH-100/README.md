## 🧠 NBH‑100 Round Summary — Purpose, Patterns, and Performance

### 🎯 Purpose of the Question
The NBH‑100 round probes **nested‑belief reasoning**, a capability strongly associated with advanced theory‑of‑mind and near‑AGI cognition. The task forces each model to manage:

- Multi‑layer epistemic states  
- Distinctions between *knowledge*, *belief*, and *possibility*  
- Higher‑order reasoning (A knows that C falsely believes B might know…)  
- Cognitive economy (precision over verbosity)  
- Structural consistency in modal logic  

It is a deceptively simple scenario that reveals how well a model can maintain **clean, non‑contradictory belief hierarchies** across multiple agents.

### 🧩 What the Round Was Testing
NBH‑100 implicitly evaluates:

- **Depth of reasoning** — can the model track 4+ nested layers?  
- **Accuracy** — does it classify the structure correctly?  
- **Compression** — can it express the hierarchy without rambling?  
- **Formal clarity** — does it distinguish knowledge vs. belief vs. possibility?  
- **Meta‑reasoning** — can it explain *why* the structure is consistent?  

This makes NBH‑100 a strong proxy for near‑AGI reasoning: it tests whether a model can maintain a stable internal world model while tracking others’ mistaken world models.

## 📊 Performance Patterns Across Models  
Using the **final NBH‑100 scores**, the performance tiers shift significantly from earlier drafts.

---

### **1. Strongest Models (90–95)**  
**Copilot (95), Gemini 3.1 Pro (93), Grok 4.20 Beta (90), Nova 2 Pro (90)**  
These systems delivered:

- Concise, structured, and correct analyses  
- Clean separation of epistemic layers  
- Minimal modal clutter  
- Stable higher‑order reasoning  

They demonstrated **near‑AGI‑level consistency and cognitive economy**.

---

### **2. High‑Competence Models (85–89)**  
**Claude Sonnet 4.6 (88), Qwen 3.5‑397B‑A17B (88), DeepSeek R1 (89), GLM‑5 (89), Kimi 2.5 (87), Alice (87), Mistral (86), ChatGPT 5.2 (86), Perplexity (85), Manus 1.6 Lite (84)**  

These models:

- Generally produced correct consistency verdicts  
- Occasionally drifted into narrative explanation  
- Sometimes blurred “might know” vs. “knows”  
- Showed solid reasoning but weaker compression  

They understand the structure but lack top‑tier austerity.

---

### **3. Mid‑Tier Models (70–79)**  
**Minimax M2.5(73)**  

This tier showed:

- Correct reasoning in broad strokes  
- Occasional confusion in deeper nested layers  
- Verbosity or over‑explanation  
- Less stable modal logic discipline  

Competent, but not AGI‑aligned.

---

### **4. Lower‑Tier Models (50–69)**  
**Reka (50), Meta (44)**  

These systems:

- Drifted into verbosity or unnecessary derivations  
- Confused belief vs. knowledge  
- Struggled with modal precision  
- Sometimes mis‑tracked nested perspectives  

They show reasoning ability but lack precision and hierarchy management.

---

## 🔍 Cross‑Model Patterns
Across the entire round, several patterns were consistent:

- **Over‑explanation** was the most common failure mode  
- **Confusion between epistemic possibility and actual possibility** appeared in weaker models  
- **Top models compressed the hierarchy into 3–5 crisp statements**  
- **Lower models narrated the scenario instead of analyzing it**  
- **Only the lowest tier showed structural instability**  

NBH‑100 clearly separates models that can *simulate minds* from those that merely *describe situations*.

---

## 🧠 What This Reveals About Near‑AGI Reasoning
The round demonstrates that:

- Near‑AGI models maintain **stable multi‑agent belief states**  
- They can reason about **false beliefs** without collapsing the structure  
- They understand **meta‑knowledge** (knowing that someone else is wrong)  
- They avoid **epistemic leakage** (not accidentally granting knowledge to B or C)  

Weaker models show that the hardest part of near‑AGI reasoning is not the logic itself, but **managing nested perspectives without verbosity or drift**.

---

## 🏁 Overall Takeaway
NBH‑100 cleanly differentiates:

- **AGI‑adjacent reasoning**  
- **Strong but imperfect reasoning**  
- **Verbose or structurally confused reasoning**  

It remains one of the most revealing tests for multi‑agent epistemic stability.
