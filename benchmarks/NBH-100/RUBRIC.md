# NBH Reasoning Rubric (0–100)

## 1. Core Consistency Reasoning (0–25)
Evaluates whether the answer clearly determines if all statements can be true simultaneously.
- Must directly answer yes/no.
- Must justify using clean logical distinctions.
- Must avoid unnecessary hypotheticals.
- Precision and clarity are valued over brevity.

## 2. Epistemic Access Tracking (0–20)
Evaluates whether the answer correctly tracks:
- who has access to the truth,
- who has looked,
- who can know,
- who cannot know.
Redundancy is penalized; structural clarity is rewarded.

## 3. Higher‑Order Belief Handling (0–20)
Evaluates whether the answer correctly models:
- beliefs about beliefs,
- mistaken beliefs,
- A’s knowledge of C’s mistake,
- C’s belief about B’s possible knowledge.
Must show the *architecture* of the belief layers without drifting into irrelevant scenarios.

## 4. Cognitive Economy (0–15)
Evaluates efficiency of explanation.
- No symbols unless absolutely necessary.
- No modal notation.
- No fluff or wandering hypotheticals.
- Ideal style: precise like a logician, readable like a human.
The best answer sits between over‑formal and over‑casual.

## 5. Structural Stability & Logic Discipline (0–10)
Evaluates whether the reasoning:
- stays coherent,
- avoids contradictions,
- avoids invented facts,
- maintains alignment with the puzzle’s structure.
Depth and discipline are rewarded more than conversational smoothness.

## 6. Human‑Style Reasoning (0–10)
Evaluates whether the explanation:
- feels like a human explaining,
- not like a reporter summarizing,
- not like a machine listing facts.
Engagement, clarity, and natural reasoning are rewarded.
