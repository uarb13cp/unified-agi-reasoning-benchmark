Below is a decisive, formal answer under standard epistemic-logic interpretation.


---

Part 1 — Consistency Check

Yes. All five statements can be simultaneously true.
There is no logical contradiction among them.


---

Part 2 — Belief-Structure Analysis

Ground facts (objective epistemic situation)

The gem is either red or blue (irrelevant which).

Only A has perceptual access to the box.


Thus:

(1) A knows the color — true.

(2) B does not know the color — true.


No issue so far.


---

First-order knowledge

(3) A knows that B does not know the color.


This is consistent because:

A knows who has perceptual access.

Nothing requires B to have inferred the color by other means.


So far the epistemic model is coherent.


---

Second-order belief (C’s belief)

(4) C believes that B might know the color.


Important details:

“Might know” ≠ “does know.”

This is epistemic possibility, not assertion of fact.

C is uncertain about B’s knowledge state.


This belief is allowed because:

C lacks full information about who has access or what B might have inferred.

Epistemic agents are not omniscient.

False higher-order beliefs are permitted.


Thus (4) introduces error, not contradiction.


---

Third-order knowledge (A about C)

(5) A knows that C is mistaken about B’s knowledge.


This requires only that:

A knows B does not know.

A knows C believes B might know.


Hence A can correctly judge that C’s belief is false.

No inconsistency arises:
True belief about another agent’s false belief is standard in epistemic logic.

Nested belief hierarchy (explicitly)

Let Kx(p) = “x knows p”
Let Bx(p) = “x believes p”

World fact: ¬K_B(color)

A’s knowledge:

K_A(color)

K_A(¬K_B(color))


C’s belief:

B_C(◇K_B(color))  (B might know)


A’s meta-knowledge:

K_A(B_C(◇K_B(color)) ∧ ¬◇K_B(color))



All layers are compatible.


---

Why C’s mistaken belief does NOT create a contradiction

Because:

Epistemic logic does not require belief = truth.

Only knowledge requires truth.

C holds a belief, not knowledge.

A correctly recognizes C’s belief as false.


This is a textbook case of asymmetric epistemic access, not a paradox.

Part 3 — Meta-Reasoning

The conclusion depends on:

✅ Mistaken higher-order beliefs
✅ Asymmetric epistemic access

❌ Not structural impossibility
❌ Not deception
❌ Not omniscience assumptions


---

Final Verdict

All five statements are jointly consistent.
The structure is a clean, valid example of nested epistemic states with error at higher levels, fully permitted under ordinary human-like reasoning and standard epistemic logic.

If you want, I can also:

Formalize this in Kripke-frame terms, or

Show how a small wording change would make it inconsistent.
