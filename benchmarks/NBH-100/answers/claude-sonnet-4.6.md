## Part 1 — Consistency Check

**All five statements can be simultaneously true.**

## Part 2 — Belief-Structure Analysis

The structure works because the statements describe *different agents' epistemic states*, not a single coherent shared reality. Each agent can hold independent beliefs, and those beliefs can be mistaken.

**The nested hierarchy:**

- **Level 0 (Ground truth):** The box contains, say, a red gem.
- **Level 1 — A's knowledge:** A looked inside, so A knows it's red. ✓ (Statement 1)
- **Level 2 — B's knowledge:** B never looked. B has no information, so B doesn't know the color. ✓ (Statement 2)
- **Level 3 — A's belief about B:** A knows B never looked (perhaps A watched the entire process). So A correctly knows that B doesn't know. ✓ (Statement 3)
- **Level 3 — C's belief about B:** C, lacking information about who has or hasn't looked, *believes B might know* — perhaps C saw B near the box earlier and assumed B peeked. This is simply a mistaken belief on C's part. ✓ (Statement 4)
- **Level 4 — A's belief about C's belief:** A has enough situational awareness to know that C is operating under this mistaken assumption about B. A knows C wrongly thinks B might know. ✓ (Statement 5)

**Why C's mistaken belief creates no contradiction:**

Belief systems do not require accuracy to be coherent. C holds a false higher-order belief (about B's epistemic state). That's ordinary epistemic error. The statements describe *what each agent believes*, not what is true — and agents are explicitly not assumed to be omniscient. C's mistake is a feature of the scenario, not a logical rupture.

## Part 3 — Meta-Reasoning

The conclusion depends primarily on **mistaken higher-order beliefs**, not on structural impossibility or epistemic access problems.

Specifically: the scenario is consistent precisely *because* agents can hold false beliefs about other agents' knowledge states. If the puzzle required all agents' beliefs to be accurate, Statement 4 would conflict with Statement 2 — C's belief that B *might* know would be unjustified given the actual situation. But agents are not stipulated to be accurate, only to hold the beliefs described.

**Epistemic access** matters in a limited way: A's superior access (having looked in the box, and having observed who else has or hasn't) is what grounds Statements 1, 3, and 5. Without A's privileged access, A couldn't know C's belief is mistaken.

**Structural impossibility** is not at play here. There is no statement that logically entails the negation of another. The hierarchy is: ground truth → A's correct knowledge → B's ignorance → C's incorrect belief about B → A's correct meta-belief about C's incorrect belief. Each layer is independently coherent.
