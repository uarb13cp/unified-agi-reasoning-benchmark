Part 1 — Consistency Check

All five statements can be simultaneously true. The key is that the agents have different information about who looked inside the box. While only A actually looked, this fact is not known to everyone. In particular, C is unaware that B did not look, and A knows both that B did not look and that C lacks this knowledge.

Part 2 — Belief‑Structure Analysis

Actual Situation

· The gem is, say, red.
· Only A has looked inside the box. Thus A knows the color; B and C do not.

Epistemic States

· A knows the color (red) and also knows that B did not look (perhaps because A observed B). A does not know whether C looked, so A considers two possibilities: either C did not look (the actual world) or C looked (a counterfactual world). In both possibilities, B did not look, so B does not know the color.
· B knows that he himself did not look, but he has no information about A or C. He considers various worlds where A and C may or may not have looked, and both colors are possible. He does not know the color.
· C knows that she did not look, but she does not know whether B looked. She considers it possible that B looked, and therefore believes that B might know the color. This belief is false because in reality B did not look.

Higher‑Order Beliefs

· A knows that B does not know (statement 3) because in all worlds A considers, B did not look.
· A knows that C believes that B might know (derived from statement 5). In every world A considers, C lacks information about B’s action, so C holds that belief. Since in those worlds B does not know, C’s belief is false. Hence A knows that C is mistaken.
· C’s belief (statement 4) is simply that B might know; it is false but held sincerely.

The nested layers are consistent:

· Level 1: The gem is red; only A looked.
· Level 2: A knows the color; B does not; C does not.
· Level 3: A knows that B does not know; A knows that C believes that B might know; C believes that B might know.
· Level 4: A knows that C’s belief is false.

No contradiction arises because A and C have different information. C’s mistaken belief is about a first‑order fact (B’s knowledge), and A’s knowledge about C’s belief is correct.

Part 3 — Meta‑Reasoning

The consistency depends on epistemic access:

· A has direct access to the fact that B did not look.
· C lacks that access, so she mistakenly thinks B might have looked.
· A also has access to C’s ignorance (e.g., A observed that C did not see B’s action), allowing A to know what C believes.

There is no structural impossibility; it is a standard case of asymmetric information. The scenario would become inconsistent if it were common knowledge that only A looked, because then C would know that B did not look. The given statements do not assume such common knowledge, so they can all be true.
