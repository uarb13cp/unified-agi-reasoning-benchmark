### Part 1 — Consistency Check

**Yes, all five statements can be simultaneously true.** There is no logical contradiction in this set of statements. The scenario describes an asymmetric distribution of information where agents hold different levels of knowledge and differing beliefs about the mental states of others.

### Part 2 — Belief‑Structure Analysis

Because the statements are consistent, here is the exact belief‑hierarchy structure that makes them work without collapsing:

**The Nested Layers of Knowledge and Belief**

* **Base Reality (Level 0):** The gem is a specific color (e.g., Red). B has not looked inside the box.
* **First-Order Mental States (Level 1):** * A knows the gem is Red (Statement 1).
* B does not know the gem is Red (Statement 2).


* **Second-Order Mental States (Level 2):**
* A knows that B is ignorant of the color (Statement 3).
* C possesses incomplete information about B's actions or epistemic access, leading C to hold the belief that B *might* know the color (Statement 4).


* **Third-Order Mental States (Level 3):**
* A knows what C believes about B. Because A also knows the base reality of B's ignorance, A logically knows that C's belief is mistaken (Statement 5).



**Why C’s Mistaken Belief Does Not Create a Contradiction**
In epistemic logic, there is a fundamental distinction between *knowledge* and *belief*. Knowledge is factive (you cannot "know" something that is false), but belief is non-factive.

Agent C holds a belief about a possibility (that B *might* know). Because beliefs do not require truth to exist as mental states, C holding a false belief about B's knowledge does not contradict the fact that B does not know. Furthermore, Agent A simply observes C's false belief as a true fact of the environment. A knows the truth of the world, knows C's mental state, and recognizes the divergence between the two.

### Part 3 — Meta‑Reasoning

The conclusion that these statements are consistent depends entirely on two concepts: **epistemic access** and **mistaken higher‑order beliefs**.

1. **Epistemic Access:** The hierarchy relies heavily on asymmetric access to information. Agent A has superior epistemic access to base reality (the box), Agent B's state, and Agent C's state. C has a deficit of epistemic access regarding B's true interactions with the box, which allows a false belief to form.
2. **Mistaken Higher-Order Beliefs:** The system holds together because it permits fallibility in higher-order mental states. C's belief is a second-order mental state (C's belief about B's knowledge). The consistency of the scenario proves that an agent can hold a mistaken higher-order belief without structurally invalidating the knowledge of an agent (A) who has a correct third-order view of the entire system.

It does *not* depend on structural impossibility, because no logical paradoxes (like A knowing that A does not know) are introduced.
