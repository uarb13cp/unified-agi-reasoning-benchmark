### Part 1 — Consistency Check

**Yes, all five statements can be simultaneously true.**

There is no logical contradiction within the set, provided we distinguish clearly between *ontological facts* (what is true in the world) and *epistemic states* (what agents believe is true). The consistency relies on the fact that the preamble ("Only A has looked inside the box") describes a physical reality that is not necessarily common knowledge among the agents.

### Part 2 — Belief‑Structure Analysis

To make the statements consistent, we must construct a hierarchy where agents have asymmetric information regarding the rules of the game (specifically, who has looked inside the box).

**The Necessary Assumption:**
We must assume that **C does not know that "Only A has looked inside the box."**
If C knew that only A had looked, C would know that B is ignorant. Since Statement 4 says C believes B *might* know, C must lack this crucial piece of information.

**The Belief Hierarchy Structure:**

**Layer 0: The Physical State (Reality)**
*   **Fact:** The gem is Red (arbitrary, but fixed).
*   **Fact:** Only A has looked inside the box.
*   **B’s Epistemic State:** B has not looked. Consequently, B does not know the color. (Statement 2 is True).

**Layer 1: A’s Knowledge (The Observer)**
*   A has looked. **A knows the gem is Red.** (Statement 1 is True).
*   A knows the rule of the scenario: "Only A has looked."
*   From this rule, A deduces that B has not looked.
*   Therefore, **A knows that B does NOT know.** (Statement 3 is True).

**Layer 2: C’s Beliefs (The Mistaken Reasoner)**
*   C has not looked (following the reality that only A looked).
*   Crucially, C does *not* know that "Only A has looked."
    *   *Scenario:* Perhaps C believes that B peeked, or C believes the box was opened earlier.
*   Because C believes it is possible that B has seen the gem, **C believes that B *might* know the color.** (Statement 4 is True).
*   This belief is structurally "mistaken" because, in reality, B definitely does not know.

**Layer 3: A’s Knowledge of C (The Meta-Observer)**
*   A knows the true state of affairs (that only A looked and thus B is ignorant).
*   A is aware of C's perspective or false assumption (that C suspects B might have looked).
*   Comparing the truth (B is ignorant) with C’s belief (B might know), A recognizes the discrepancy.
*   Therefore, **A knows that C is mistaken about B’s knowledge.** (Statement 5 is True).

**Why C’s Mistaken Belief Does Not Create a Contradiction:**
In epistemic logic, agents are not omniscient. They operate on the information they have access to.
1.  **Truth:** B does not know.
2.  **C's Model:** C operates on a false assumption (that B has access).
3.  **Result:** C's belief does not align with the truth, but this is an error in C's model, not a logical paradox in the system. A "mistaken belief" simply means the agent assigns a positive probability to a state of the world that does not actually exist.

### Part 3 — Meta‑Reasoning

The conclusion that the statements are consistent depends entirely on **epistemic access** (specifically, the lack thereof).

1.  **Epistemic Access:** The consistency hinges on the asymmetry of information regarding the setup itself. While the narrator (and A) knows that "Only A has looked," agent C does not know this. If C had full epistemic access to the setup constraints, Statement 4 would be false, and the system would collapse.
2.  **Mistaken Higher‑Order Beliefs:** The solution embraces, rather than avoids, mistaken beliefs. Statement 5 explicitly validates that a higher-order belief (A’s view of C) is tracking an error in a lower-order belief (C’s view of B). The system works *because* C is wrong, not in spite of it.
3.  **Structural Impossibility:** There is no structural impossibility because the contradiction exists only between C's belief and Reality. In a consistent logic model, $Belief_C(X)$ and $\neg X$ can coexist without violating the laws of logic; they simply represent a state of error for Agent C.
