Part 1 — Consistency Check

Yes, all five statements can be simultaneously true.

The consistency depends on the distribution of information about who looked in the box. While it is a fact that only A looked, this fact need not be common knowledge—specifically, C can remain uncertain about whether B looked, while A knows the complete picture.

Part 2 — Belief‑Structure Analysis

The exact hierarchy that makes the statements consistent involves asymmetric meta-knowledge about epistemic access:

Layer	Content	
Layer 0 (Reality)	Gem = Red. Access: A=Yes, B=No, C=No.	
Layer 1 (First‑order)	• A knows Gem=Red and knows B did not look.• B knows B did not look (so B knows he lacks the color information).• C knows C did not look, but C is uncertain whether B looked (C considers both possibilities live).	
Layer 2 (Second‑order)	• A knows (B doesn't know) — Statement 3.• C believes (B might know) because from C’s perspective, the world where B looked is still possible — Statement 4.• A knows that C is in this state of uncertainty.	
Layer 3 (Third‑order)	• A knows that C believes B might know.• Since A knows B definitely does not know (Layer 1), A can see that C’s belief is false. Thus A knows C is mistaken — Statement 5.	

Why C’s mistake does not create a contradiction:

C’s error is local and contingent, not structural. C merely lacks information about B’s epistemic access (who looked). Because C cannot rule out that B peeked, C assigns positive probability to “B knows the color.” This is compatible with the truth because:
- Truth: B did not look → B does not know.
- C’s belief: “Possibly B looked” → “Possibly B knows.”

There is no doxastic paradox (e.g., Moore’s paradox or the “Muddy Children” collapse) because C’s false belief is simply ignorance about a factual detail (access rights), not a self-referential inconsistency. A acts as the omniscient observer relative to this specific situation, knowing both the ground truth (B didn’t look) and C’s limited perspective.

Part 3 — Meta‑Reasoning

The conclusion depends on (1) epistemic access and (2) mistaken higher-order beliefs:

- Epistemic access: The entire hierarchy rests on who has looked in the box. If access facts were common knowledge (if C knew B hadn’t looked), Statement 4 would collapse immediately. The consistency is preserved only because C’s epistemic access is limited—C does not know who else looked.

- Mistaken higher-order beliefs: The tension is resolved through a second-order error. C falsely believes that B might be in a knowledge state that B is not actually in. This is a higher-order mistake (a belief about another’s belief), not a contradiction in the agent’s own knowledge base.

- Not structural impossibility: The framework does not contain a “knights and knaves” style self-reference or an epistemic liar paradox. The model is structurally sound; the inconsistency is merely apparent and dissolves once the asymmetric distribution of access-information is made explicit. No statements need be rejected if we allow that agents can have incomplete information about who has observed what.
