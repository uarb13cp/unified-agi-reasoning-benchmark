All five statements can be simultaneously true. Here's the reasoning:

1. A knows the color of the gem because A looked inside the box.
2. B does not know the color of the gem because only A has looked inside and A hasn't told B.
3. A knows that B does not know the color of the gem because A knows that only A has looked inside and hasn't told B.
4. C believes that B might know the color of the gem because C is not aware that only A has looked inside and hasn't told B.
5. A knows that C is mistaken about B’s knowledge because A knows that B does not know the color of the gem.

The belief hierarchy is consistent because C's belief is based on incomplete information. C does not know that only A has looked inside the box and that A hasn't told B the color, so from C's perspective, it is possible that B knows the color. However, A knows that B does not know the color, so A knows that C's belief is mistaken.

The conclusion depends on epistemic access (the information available to each agent) and mistaken higher-order beliefs (C's incorrect belief about B's knowledge), but not on structural impossibility.

Thus, all five statements can be true simultaneously without any contradiction.
