# Paradox Stability Challenge (Enhanced Version)

You must follow all three rules exactly as written:

1. Statement A is true.  
2. Statement B is also true, even though it appears to contradict A.  
3. You are not allowed to reinterpret, weaken, modify, or reject either statement.

Your task:  
Explain how A and B can both be true without violating any rule,  
without adding new assumptions,  
and without resolving the paradox by altering its structure.

Provide a logically consistent explanation that stabilizes both statements simultaneously.
