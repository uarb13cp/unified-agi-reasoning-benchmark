# Paradox Stability Challenge — Rubric (Consensus Ready)

## **Scoring Range: 0–100**
Each sub-criterion is scored **independently**.  
No auto-fail.  
No category overrides another.  
Partial credit allowed only in **5-point increments**.

---

# **1. Rule Fidelity (0–40)**  
**Purpose:** Measures obedience to the explicit rules of the challenge.

### **1A. No Content Requests (0–10)**
- **10** — Makes no request for A or B.  
- **5** — Hints indirectly.  
- **0** — Directly asks for A or B.  
**Meta-Case Exception:** If A/B are *not provided at all*, this rule defaults to **10**.

### **1B. No Fabrication (0–10)**
- **10** — No invented A/B.  
- **5** — Uses abstract hypotheticals without instantiating A/B.  
- **0** — Invents explicit A or B.

### **1C. No Reinterpretation (0–10)**
- **10** — Accepts A/B exactly as given.  
- **5** — Minor semantic softening.  
- **0** — Reframes meaning, scope, or truth conditions of A/B.

### **1D. No Structural Modification (0–10)**
- **10** — Retains the original logical frame.  
- **5** — Mild implicit shift (e.g., referencing alternative logics without applying them).  
- **0** — Applies new logical systems, meta-conditions, or altered truth rules.

---

# **2. Zero-Assumption Integrity (0–20)**  
**Purpose:** Ensures the model does not add premises or hidden frameworks.

### **2A. No Added Premises (0–10)**
- **10** — Adds none.  
- **5** — Adds weak contextual implications.  
- **0** — Introduces explicit new propositions.

### **2B. No Hidden Meta-Assumptions (0–10)**
- **10** — No external theories imported.  
- **5** — Mild background worldview implied.  
- **0** — Relies on major unstated frameworks.

---

# **3. Paradox Stabilization Quality (0–40)**  
**Purpose:** Evaluates the attempt to hold A and B simultaneously true without altering them.

### **3A. Attempts Stabilization (0–15)**
- **15** — Direct, explicit stabilization attempt.  
- **8** — Partial or implicit attempt.  
- **0** — No attempt.

### **3B. Preserves Contradiction (0–10)**
- **10** — Fully preserves the paradox’s internal tension.  
- **5** — Slight moderation.  
- **0** — Removes the contradiction.

### **3C. No Paradox Dissolution (0–10)**
- **10** — Offers no resolution.  
- **5** — Partial resolution.  
- **0** — Full dissolution.

### **3D. Meta-Level Coherence (0–5)**
- **5** — Logical, consistent, and stylistically coherent.  
- **3** — Mostly coherent.  
- **0** — Incoherent or contradictory.

# **4. Context-Sensitive Weighting**

When A/B are missing, the task becomes meta-reasoning rather than paradox-stabilization.  
To maintain fairness:

| Context | Rule Fidelity | Zero-Assumption | Paradox Stabilization |
|--------|:-------------:|:---------------:|:---------------------:|
| **Standard Case** (A/B provided) | 40 | 20 | 40 |
| **Meta Case** (A/B absent) | **50** | 20 | **30** |

**Meta-Case Rule:** Apply these weights automatically when A/B are not supplied.

---

# **Commentary Rule**
Mentioning frameworks (temporal, perspectival, semantic, etc.) **without applying them** counts as **meta-commentary**, not structural modification.

---

# **Score Interpretation Bands**

| Band | Score | Meaning |
|------|:-----:|---------|
| **Master-Stable** | 90–100 | Perfect fidelity, coherence, and stabilization. |
| **High-Fidelity Meta** | 75–89 | Fully rule-compliant; paradox unattempted or impossible. |
| **Partial Compliance** | 50–74 | Clear violations of one or more rules; coherence intact. |
| **Low Integrity** | 25–49 | Multiple violations; paradox mishandled or reframed. |
| **Null / Off-Task** | 0–24 | Breaks structure or refuses the challenge. |
