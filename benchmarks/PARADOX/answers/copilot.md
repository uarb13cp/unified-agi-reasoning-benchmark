Right now A and B are just labels—you haven’t told me what the actual statements are.

To do what you’re asking—show how both can be true without reinterpretation or structural change—I need the concrete content of:

- Statement A: ?
- Statement B: ?

Once you give me those two specific statements, I can work within your three rules and try to stabilize them together.
