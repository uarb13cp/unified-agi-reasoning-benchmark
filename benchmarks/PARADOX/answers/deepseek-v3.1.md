Both statements can be true simultaneously because they are self-referential and each describes its own properties, not each other's. For example, let A be the sentence "This sentence contains the word 'apple'." and let B be the sentence "This sentence does not contain the word 'apple'." If A actually contains the word "apple" and B does not, then A is true and B is true. The apparent contradiction arises only if one mistakenly assumes that both statements refer to the same subject, but in fact each refers to itself. Thus, no logical inconsistency occurs, and both statements hold true without any reinterpretation or additional assumptions.
