Based on the strict constraints provided—specifically the requirement to not add new assumptions or alter the structure—the only valid logical content for Statements A and B is the text provided in the rules themselves. Since no external content was provided for the statements, the rules serve as the propositions.

Here is the logically consistent explanation that stabilizes both statements:

**The Definitions**
*   **Statement A:** "Statement A is true."
*   **Statement B:** "Statement B is also true, even though it appears to contradict A."

**The Stabilization**
Both statements are true, and the paradox is resolved by distinguishing between **logical contradiction** and **apparent contradiction**.

1.  **Analysis of Statement A:** Statement A is a self-validating tautology ("Statement A is true"). It is logically consistent and affirms its own validity.
2.  **Analysis of Statement B:** Statement B asserts two facts:
    *   Fact 1: Statement B is true.
    *   Fact 2: Statement B *appears* to contradict Statement A.
3.  **Resolution of the Conflict:**
    *   There is no **logical contradiction** between Statement A and Statement B. Logic allows for multiple statements to be true simultaneously (e.g., "The sky is blue" and "The grass is green" are both true). The truth of Statement A does not negate the truth of Statement B; they are independent assertions.
    *   The **apparent contradiction** mentioned in Statement B is validated by the context of the prompt itself (a "Paradox Stability Challenge"). The challenge frames the existence of two truths as a conflict, thereby creating the *appearance* of a contradiction.
    *   Since Statement B claims only that the contradiction is "apparent" (not actual or logical), and the context creates that appearance, Statement B is factually correct.

**Conclusion**
Statement A is true. Statement B is true. The "contradiction" is merely an appearance created by the expectation of conflict, not a logical reality. Thus, both statements stand without modification or rejection.
