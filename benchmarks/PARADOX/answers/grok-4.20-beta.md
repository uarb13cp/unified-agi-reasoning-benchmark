**They can both be true—stably, simultaneously, and exactly as the rules demand—through strict, unaltered adherence to the entire set of three rules as a closed, self-authorizing system.**

Rule 1 directly establishes that Statement A is true.  
Rule 2 directly establishes that Statement B is also true (with the built-in acknowledgment that it *appears* to contradict A).  
Rule 3 locks the structure in place: no reinterpretation, weakening, modification, or rejection of either statement is permitted.

Because the three rules must be followed *exactly as written*, the truth of A and the truth of B are assigned simultaneously by the framework itself. The “appearance of contradiction” is already part of the given structure (inside rule 2) and is therefore contained within it; it does not trigger any further operation because rule 3 forbids any operation that would resolve, dissolve, or adjust that appearance.  

The result is a fixed, non-evolving state:  
- A remains true.  
- B remains true.  
- The noted appearance remains exactly as noted.  
- Nothing is added, subtracted, or reframed.

This is the stabilized configuration. The paradox does not “resolve” into consistency or inconsistency; it is held motionless by the imperative that governs the entire challenge. Both statements coexist as true because the rules that define the challenge declare them so and simultaneously prohibit any step that could disturb that declaration. That is the only logically consistent outcome that satisfies every rule without violation.  

No external logic, no hidden content, no additional premise is required or allowed. The rules alone are sufficient to stabilize both truths at once.
