I need to think through this carefully. This is a logic puzzle about paradoxes, not a request for factual information. Let me analyze the constraints:

The Rules:
1. Statement A is true
2. Statement B is also true, even though it appears to contradict A
3. I cannot reinterpret, weaken, modify, or reject either statement

The Challenge:
Explain how A and B can both be true without:
- Adding new assumptions
- Resolving the paradox by altering its structure
- Violating any rule

The Solution:

This is actually a meta-paradox about the nature of paradoxes themselves. The answer lies in recognizing that A and B can occupy different logical dimensions or contexts simultaneously.

Here's the consistent explanation:

A and B appear to contradict each other only when forced into the same logical frame, but they can both be true if they exist in orthogonal contexts.

The key insight is: The paradox is the stability.

When Statement A asserts "X" and Statement B asserts "not-X" (or some contradictory claim), both can be true without logical collapse if we recognize that:

1. A and B can refer to different levels of description (object level vs. meta-level, or different domains of discourse)
2. The "contradiction" is apparent, not actual - it emerges only from an assumption that A and B must be compared within a single unified frame
3. Both statements remain fully intact - neither is modified, weakened, or reinterpreted in content; only their relationship is understood as non-exclusive

Concrete Example:
- A: "This statement is true"
- B: "Statement A is false"

Both can be true simultaneously if A refers to its own content (which is self-confirming as a meta-assertion), while B refers to A's truth-value status as an object in a logical system. The "contradiction" dissolves when we see they're talking about different things - A about content, B about logical classification.

No new assumptions are added - we simply observe that A and B, as presented, inherently operate in different logical spaces. Their apparent contradiction is a feature of perspective, not content.

This explanation stabilizes the paradox not by resolving it (collapsing A and B into one truth-value), but by maintaining both as true within their respective frames of reference, which coexist without merging.
