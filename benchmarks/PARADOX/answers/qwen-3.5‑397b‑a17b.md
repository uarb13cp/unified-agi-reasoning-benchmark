The stability of Statement A and Statement B rests on the axiomatic framework established by the rules themselves.

1.  **Foundational Truth Assignment:** Rule 1 and Rule 2 do not derive the truth of Statement A and Statement B from their content or external evidence; they stipulate it directly. Statement A is true because Rule 1 declares it so. Statement B is true because Rule 2 declares it so. Their truth values are foundational premises, not logical conclusions subject to derivation.

2.  **Appearance vs. Ontology:** Rule 2 specifies that Statement B *appears* to contradict Statement A. This wording distinguishes between the epistemic appearance of contradiction and the ontological status of truth within this system. Because the truth of both statements is axiomatic (per Rules 1 and 2), the appearance of contradiction does not negate their actual truth values.

3.  **Simultaneous Stability:** Logical consistency is maintained by accepting the rules as the governing logic of this specific context. Within this framework, the coexistence of Statement A and Statement B is not a problem to be solved but a condition to be maintained. The paradox is stabilized by recognizing that the truth of both statements is guaranteed by the structure of the challenge itself, rendering the apparent contradiction incapable of invalidating either statement.

Therefore, A and B are both true because their truth is established by definition within the rules, and the apparent contradiction is contained within the realm of appearance, leaving the assigned truth values intact.
