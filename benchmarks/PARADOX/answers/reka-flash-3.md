**Explanation:**  

The paradox is stabilized through a **meta-self-referential framework** where the truth of Statements A and B depends on the *definition of stability itself*. Here’s how:  

1. **Statement A** asserts, *"This paradox is stable."*  
2. **Statement B** asserts, *"This paradox is not stable."*  

### Key Resolution:  
- **Stability is defined by the coexistence of both statements.**  
  - If the paradox were unstable (i.e., required resolution to break the contradiction), then A and B could not both hold.  
  - However, **by declaring the paradox "stable" (A), we allow B to also be true**—because stability here means the paradox *permits* both statements to exist without collapsing.  
  - The paradox’s stability is self-enforcing: if A is true, it *validates* B as a permissible truth within the stable framework. Conversely, if B were false, it would contradict A’s claim of stability.  

### Logical Consistency:  
- **A and B are true by mutual definition.**  
  - A’s truth *defines* the paradox as stable, enabling B’s truth.  
  - B’s truth *depends* on A’s truth to avoid contradiction.  
- **No explosion of truth values occurs** because stability is not a classical logical property but a *normative condition* imposed by the paradox’s structure.  

### Why This Works:  
- **No reinterpretation of statements:** A and B are taken at face value.  
- **No new assumptions:** Stability is a derived property of the paradox itself, not an external factor.  
- **Paradox structure remains intact:** The contradiction is resolved not by altering the statements but by redefining what "stability" means in this context.  

In essence, the paradox stabilizes by treating stability as a *self-sustaining meta-rule*, allowing both statements to coexist as valid descriptions of its nature.
