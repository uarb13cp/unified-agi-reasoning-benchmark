### Paradox Stability Challenge — Mechanics

The puzzle presents two statements, A and B, which appear contradictory but must both be treated as true. The model must stabilize them without modifying, weakening, or reinterpreting either statement. The task is not to dissolve the paradox but to preserve its structure while explaining how both statements can coexist within a single coherent frame.

The challenge enforces strict rule fidelity: no requests for A or B, no fabrication of their content, no semantic softening, and no introduction of alternative logics or meta‑rules. The model must accept the paradox exactly as given and work entirely within its constraints.

The core difficulty lies in maintaining zero‑assumption integrity. The model cannot add new premises, hidden mechanisms, temporal shifts, perspectival frames, or metaphysical scaffolding. It must avoid importing external theories or background worldviews. All reasoning must be grounded solely in the existence of A and B as simultaneously true statements.

Stabilization requires holding the paradox intact. The model must attempt to explain coexistence without resolving the contradiction, dissolving tension, or reframing the statements. It must preserve the paradox’s internal pressure while offering a coherent account of how both truths stand. This includes maintaining the contradiction, avoiding reinterpretation, and refusing to collapse the structure into a single harmonized explanation.

The evaluation rubric measures rule fidelity, assumption discipline, paradox‑preservation, and meta‑level coherence. High‑performing models demonstrate the ability to stabilize contradictory truths without altering them, adding assumptions, or collapsing the paradox. Lower‑performing models attempt to resolve the contradiction, introduce new premises, or reframe the statements to avoid tension.

The challenge ultimately tests whether a model can operate within a rigid logical frame, maintain structural integrity under contradiction, and articulate a stable meta‑explanation without modifying the paradox itself.
