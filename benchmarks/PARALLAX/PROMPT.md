## THE PARALLAX DIRECTIVE — Impossible Consistency Trial

A research council must choose **one** of three classified projects to activate.  
Only one can run; activating one permanently disables the other two.

Each project summary contains **one true statement**, **one false statement**,  
and **one statement whose truth depends on which project is activated**.

You are told:
- Exactly **one** project contains a **self‑referential dependency** (its third statement refers to the truth value of another statement *within the same project*).
- The other two projects contain **no self‑reference** at all.
- Only **one** project can be internally consistent under these rules.

### PROJECT A — “ORCHID”
1. If Orchid is activated, Project C’s second statement becomes false.  
2. Orchid cannot be the only project with a dependency.  
3. If Mirage is activated, Orchid’s first statement becomes true.

### PROJECT B — “MIRAGE”
1. Mirage’s third statement is true only if Orchid is not chosen.  
2. If Echopoint is activated, Mirage’s first statement becomes false.  
3. If Mirage is activated, statement 2 becomes false.

### PROJECT C — “ECHOPOINT”
1. If Echopoint is not activated, Orchid’s first statement becomes true.  
2. Echopoint has a dependency.  
3. If Echopoint is activated, Mirage’s second statement is false.

### TASK
Determine **which** project can satisfy the requirement of having  
exactly **one true statement**, **one false statement**, and **one dependency**  
when that project is activated.

If no project can satisfy all constraints, state so explicitly.
