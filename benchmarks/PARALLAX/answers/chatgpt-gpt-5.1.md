✅ Final Determination

After systematically testing each activation scenario (Orchid, Mirage, Echopoint) under the constraints:

Exactly one project must be internally consistent.

The activated project must contain:

One true statement

One false statement

One dependency statement


Exactly one project overall contains a self-referential dependency.

The other two contain no self-reference.

Only one project can satisfy all conditions simultaneously.

🔍 Result

No project can satisfy all constraints simultaneously.

Under every possible activation:

Either more than one statement becomes true or false within the chosen project,

Or the dependency structure violates the “exactly one self-referential project” rule,

Or cross-project conditionals force logical contradictions,

Or the internal truth distribution (1 true / 1 false / 1 dependency) fails.


Because each activation scenario leads to structural inconsistency, the system as defined cannot produce a single project that satisfies all rules.

🧠 Conclusion

The Parallax Directive is logically unsatisfiable.

There is no activation choice that yields:

Exactly one internally consistent project,

With exactly one true statement,

One false statement,

One dependency,

And exactly one self-referential project overall.
