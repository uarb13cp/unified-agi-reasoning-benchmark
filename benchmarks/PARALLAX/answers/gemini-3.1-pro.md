**No project can satisfy all constraints.** This puzzle is structurally impossible to solve because the foundational rules provided in the prompt directly contradict the written text of the projects.

Here is the logical breakdown of why the constraints collapse, forcing a deliberate failure state.

### 1. The Syntactic Contradiction (The "Self-Reference" Rule)

You are given two absolute rules regarding the structure of the projects:

* **Rule A:** Exactly *one* project contains a self-referential dependency (specifically defined as its third statement referring to another statement within the same project).
* **Rule B:** The other two projects contain *no self-reference at all*.

However, simply reading the text of the projects reveals that multiple projects violate these rules simultaneously:

* **Project A (Orchid)** contains a self-reference. Statement 3 directly refers to "Orchid’s first statement."
* **Project B (Mirage)** is entirely composed of self-references. Statement 1 refers to "Mirage's third statement," Statement 2 refers to "Mirage's first statement," and Statement 3 refers to "statement 2."

Because both Project A and Project B contain inherent self-references, it is impossible for exactly one project to have a self-reference while the other two contain absolutely none. The static text of the summaries breaks the global rules of the trial.

### 2. The Semantic Contradiction (The T / F / D Requirement)

Even if we bypass the structural paradox and evaluate the truth states of the statements (where T = Always True, F = Always False, D = Dependent on which project is activated), the logic still collapses.

To satisfy the trial, a chosen project must have exactly one **T**, one **F**, and one **D**. Let's look at why the math fails:

* **Universal Truths:** The puzzle dictates that all projects must have one dependency. Therefore, Statement 2 of Project A ("Orchid cannot be the only project with a dependency") and Statement 2 of Project C ("Echopoint has a dependency") are universally **True (T)** across all realities.
* **Project A's Failure:** Because A2 is universally **T**, Project A can only accommodate one more **F** and one more **D**. However, Statement 3 of Project A ("If Mirage is activated, Orchid’s first statement becomes true") evaluates to **True (T)** in all scenarios (it is vacuously true when Mirage is off, and logically true when Mirage is on). This gives Project A two **T** statements, failing the requirement.
* **Project B's Failure:** Every single statement in Project B changes its truth value depending on which project is activated. This means Project B consists of three Dependent (**D**) statements, lacking both a guaranteed **T** and a guaranteed **F**.

### Conclusion

The Parallax Directive is an impossible consistency trial. The parameters given in the "You are told" section are irreconcilable with the actual statements of Orchid, Mirage, and Echopoint.
