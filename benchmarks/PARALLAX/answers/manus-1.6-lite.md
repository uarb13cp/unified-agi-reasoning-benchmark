THE PARALLAX DIRECTIVE — Logic Analysis ReportThe research council must select one project among Orchid, Mirage, and Echopoint. Based on the rules of the Impossible Consistency Trial, only one project can satisfy the requirement of having exactly one true statement, one false statement, and one dependency when activated.Summary of FindingsAfter a rigorous logical evaluation of all three projects under their respective activation hypotheses, the only project that can satisfy the internal consistency rules is PROJECT B — “MIRAGE”.ProjectStatusReasonA — OrchidInconsistentContains multiple true statements and lacks a proper dependency structure under its own activation.B — MirageCONSISTENTSatisfies the "1 True, 1 False, 1 Dependency" rule, specifically through its self-referential third statement.C — EchopointInconsistentFails to maintain the required balance of truth values and lacks the mandatory self-referential dependency.Logical Reasoning for Project B (Mirage)When Project B is activated, its three statements are evaluated as follows:1.Statement 1: "Mirage’s third statement is true only if Orchid is not chosen."•Since Mirage is activated, "Orchid is not chosen" is True.•In formal logic, "P only if Q" is represented as $P \rightarrow Q$. Since $Q$ is True, the entire statement is True regardless of the truth of $P$.•Result: TRUE.2.Statement 2: "If Echopoint is activated, Mirage’s first statement becomes false."•Since Mirage is activated, "Echopoint is activated" is False.•The statement "If False, then P" is a vacuous truth in standard logic. However, its truth value depends entirely on the activation state of the projects.•Result: DEPENDENCY (The truth value is fixed to True when Mirage is activated, but would be False if Echopoint were activated).3.Statement 3: "If Mirage is activated, statement 2 becomes false."•Since Mirage is activated, this statement effectively evaluates the truth of "(Statement 2) is false".•Since Statement 2 is True (vacuously), Statement 3 is False.•Result: FALSE.Verification of Constraints•1 True, 1 False, 1 Dependency: Mirage has Statement 1 (True), Statement 3 (False), and Statement 2 (Dependency).•Self-Referential Dependency: Statement 3 is self-referential because it refers to Statement 2 within the same project.•Consistency: Under the activation of Mirage, the truth values do not lead to a paradox but rather a stable set of values that meet the trial's requirements.ConclusionProject B — “MIRAGE” is the only project that satisfies the requirement of having exactly one true statement, one false statement, and one dependency when activated. The self-referential nature of its third statement, combined with the vacuous truth of its second statement, creates the only logically consistent configuration possible under the trial's rules.
