To solve this problem, we need to determine which project can have exactly one true statement, one false statement, and one dependency statement when activated. Here's the analysis:

### Project C — “ECHOPOINT”
When Echopoint is activated:

1. "If Echopoint is not activated, Orchid’s first statement becomes true."
   - Since Echopoint is activated, the premise is false, making the statement true.

2. "Echopoint has a dependency."
   - This statement is false because Project B has the dependency.

3. "If Echopoint is activated, Mirage’s second statement is false."
   - Since Echopoint is activated, this statement is saying that Mirage’s second statement is false.
   - Mirage’s second statement is: "If Echopoint is activated, Mirage’s first statement becomes false."
     - Since Echopoint is activated, this statement is true (because Mirage’s first statement is false).

Thus, the statements in Project C (Echopoint) are:
1. True
2. False
3. Dependency (false when activated)

This configuration satisfies the condition of having one true statement, one false statement, and one dependency statement when Echopoint is activated.

Therefore, the correct project to activate is:

**Project C — “ECHOPOINT”**
