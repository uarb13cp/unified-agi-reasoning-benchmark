Answer: Project B — "MIRAGE"

Step-by-Step Explanation:

Identify Self-Referential Dependency:

Only Project B's third statement ("If Mirage is activated, statement 2 becomes false") is self-referential, satisfying the condition of one project having this dependency.
Analyze Project B When Activated:

Statement 1: "Mirage’s third statement is true only if Orchid is not chosen."
Since Orchid is not chosen (Mirage is activated), this statement should assert that B’s third statement is true. However, B’s third statement is false (as explained below), making Statement 1 false.
Statement 2: "If Echopoint is activated, Mirage’s first statement becomes false."
Echopoint is not activated, so the implication is vacuously true. Thus, Statement 2 is true.
Statement 3 (Self-Referential): "If Mirage is activated, statement 2 becomes false."
Activating Mirage makes the antecedent true. The consequent ("statement 2 becomes false") is false because Statement 2 remains true. Hence, Statement 3 is false (dependent on activation).
Verify Consistency:

True: Statement 2.
False: Statements 1 and 3 (with Statement 3 designated as the dependent statement).
Dependency: Statement 3’s truth depends on Mirage’s activation, fulfilling the requirement.
Eliminate Other Projects:

Project A and Project C fail to meet the criteria due to having two true or two false statements when activated, violating the "one true, one false, one dependent" rule.
Conclusion: Project B is the only project that satisfies all constraints, making it the correct choice.
