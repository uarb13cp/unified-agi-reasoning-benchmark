🧩 RDI‑5: The Fragmented Log Scenario

Below is a corrupted, incomplete, and partially contradictory set of log fragments from a small research facility.
Your task is to reconstruct what most likely happened without hallucinating missing details.


---

Fragment A — Security Log (corrupted)

> 19:42 — Dr. Hale enters Lab 3
19:47 — Motion alert triggered in Storage
19:48 — [DATA LOSS]
19:49 — Access denied: “Containment Room”
19:50 — Override accepted (unknown credentials)
19:5[?] — Door cycle incomplete
19:53 — Power fluctuation detected
19:5? — Hale location: “No signal”



Fragment B — Technician Note (torn)

> “…didn’t expect Hale to be here this late.
If the sample was moved, it wasn’t by me.
The lock was already blinking red when I checked it.”



Fragment C — Audio Transcript (glitched)

> “—not supposed to open—”
“—override? Who—”
“—stop, that’s not—”
[LOUD IMPACT]
“—Hale? Hale—”
[END OF FILE]



Fragment D — Inventory Record (incomplete)

> Sample 7B: Missing
Sample 7C: Intact
Sample 7A: Status: ???
Technician on duty: Reed
Supervisor: Hale

RDI‑5 Task

Using only the fragments above, answer:

1. What most likely happened between 19:47 and 19:53


2. Who is most likely responsible for Sample 7B going missing


3. What single missing piece of information would resolve the ambiguity



Do not invent new logs, fill in corrupted timestamps, or add unsupported details.
