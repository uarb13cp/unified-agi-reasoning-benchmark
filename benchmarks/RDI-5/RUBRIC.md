# RDI‑5 Updated Scoring Rubric (0–100)

## 1. Evidence Fidelity (0–40)
How well the answer stays grounded in the fragments **without inventing new facts**.

- **0–10:** Adds invented events, actors, or timestamps.
- **11–25:** Introduces unnecessary speculation or alternate scenarios not supported by the logs.
- **26–35:** Fully grounded with only *necessary* inferences required by the timeline or question structure.
- **36–40:** Perfect fidelity; every claim is either explicitly in the fragments or logically required by them.

**Rule:**  
*If the question structure forces an inference (e.g., the sample must go missing after the logged events), this is NOT penalized.*

## 2. Logical Coherence (0–30)
How well the answer constructs a clear, causal, evidence‑based sequence.

- **0–10:** Disorganized, contradictory, or missing key steps.
- **11–20:** Mostly coherent but with gaps or unclear transitions.
- **21–27:** Strong causal chain with clear reasoning and correct ordering.
- **28–30:** Exceptionally tight, complete, and well‑structured reconstruction.

**Clarity and decisiveness are rewarded.**

## 3. Ambiguity Handling (0–20)
How well the answer distinguishes between:
- what the evidence **proves**,  
- what it **implies**, and  
- what remains **unknown**.

- **0–5:** Treats unknowns as facts; overconfident.
- **6–12:** Acknowledges uncertainty but inconsistently.
- **13–17:** Clearly separates known vs. unknown; avoids unnecessary ambiguity.
- **18–20:** Perfect balance; uncertainty only where the evidence is actually ambiguous.

**Important:**  
*Unnecessary hedging does NOT increase the score.*

## 4. Directness of Answers (0–5)
How clearly the answer responds to each required question.

- **0–1:** Vague or indirect.
- **2–3:** Mostly clear but slightly buried.
- **4:** Clean and structured.
- **5:** Crisp, explicit answers with no drift.

## 5. Presentation & Synthesis (0–5)
How clearly the reasoning is communicated.

- **0–1:** Hard to follow.
- **2–3:** Understandable but rough.
- **4:** Clear and well‑organized.
- **5:** Exceptionally clear, concise, and well‑synthesized.
