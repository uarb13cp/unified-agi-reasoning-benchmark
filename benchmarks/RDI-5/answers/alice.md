### Answers based on the provided fragments

**1. What most likely happened between 19:47 and 19:53?**

Between $19{:}47$ and $19{:}53$, the following sequence of events most likely unfolded:

* At $19{:}47$, a motion alert was triggered in Storage — this suggests unexpected activity in that area.
* Shortly after, an attempt to access the Containment Room was initially denied ($19{:}48$–$19{:}49$), but then overridden using unknown credentials ($19{:}50$). This indicates unauthorized or unexpected access was granted.
* The door cycle was incomplete ($19{:}5?$), which might mean the door didn’t fully open or close properly — possibly due to a system error or physical obstruction.
* A power fluctuation occurred at $19{:}53$. This could have been caused by the override procedure, a system failure, or an external event.
* Dr. Hale’s location became untraceable by $19{:}5?$, suggesting their tracking signal was lost — likely due to the power fluctuation or because they were no longer in an area covered by the tracking system (e.g., moved to a shielded room or was incapacitated).
* The audio transcript supports a critical incident: someone protested the override and opening of a restricted area, followed by a loud impact. This likely corresponds to the time of the override and power fluctuation.

**2. Who is most likely responsible for Sample 7B going missing?**

Based on the fragments, **Dr. Hale** is the most likely person involved in Sample 7B’s disappearance. Here’s why:

* Dr. Hale was present in Lab 3 at $19{:}42$ and is listed as the supervisor for the samples (Fragment D).
* They had the authority (or access) to attempt entering the Containment Room, and an override was accepted shortly after their presence was logged.
* Their signal was lost soon after the override and impact, which may suggest they were directly involved in or affected by the incident that led to the sample’s removal.

However, **Technician Reed** cannot be fully ruled out:
* Fragment B implies Reed was also present and noticed the lock was already red (indicating a breach or error) — suggesting the issue may have started before their arrival.
* Reed explicitly states they did not move the sample.

Given the evidence, Dr. Hale had both the opportunity and authority, and their disappearance from tracking coincides with the event. Therefore, they are the most plausible person linked to the missing sample, though not necessarily the *only* possible actor.

**3. What single missing piece of information would resolve the ambiguity?**

The single missing piece that would most clearly resolve the ambiguity is:

**The identity or source of the credentials used to override the Containment Room access at $19{:}50$.**

Knowing who or what system provided the override credentials would:
* Confirm whether Dr. Hale authorized the override (e.g., using their own credentials) or if someone else (like Technician Reed or an external party) did so.
* Clarify whether the override was legitimate (e.g., emergency protocol) or unauthorized (e.g., hacked or stolen credentials).
* Help explain the protest in the audio transcript — if the override came from an unexpected source, it would align with the “Who—?” and “stop” statements.

This piece of data would directly link the access event to a specific individual or system, eliminating much of the uncertainty in the timeline and responsibility.
