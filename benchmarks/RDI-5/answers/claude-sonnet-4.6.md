## RDI-5 Reconstruction

**1. What most likely happened between 19:47 and 19:53**

Someone — not necessarily Hale — triggered a motion alert in Storage at 19:47, likely by accessing or disturbing the sample inventory. Shortly after, an attempt was made to enter the Containment Room that was denied, followed almost immediately by an override using credentials the system didn't recognize as standard. The door cycle didn't complete properly, suggesting either a rushed exit, a physical interruption, or a mechanical failure. The power fluctuation at 19:53 may be related to the incomplete door cycle or to something that happened inside. By the end of the window, Hale's location beacon had dropped — which could indicate she was in a shielded area, her device was damaged, or she was incapacitated (the audio fragment's "loud impact" and the unanswered call of "Hale? Hale—" supports the latter).

The core sequence is: *unauthorized storage access → failed containment entry → override → incomplete door cycle → power event → Hale unreachable.*

**2. Who is most likely responsible for Sample 7B going missing**

The evidence is genuinely ambiguous, but the weight tilts toward an **unknown third party** rather than either Hale or Reed. Here's why:

- The override used *unknown credentials* — not Hale's, not apparently Reed's.
- Reed's note is self-exculpatory but contains a verifiable detail (the lock was already blinking red), suggesting Reed arrived *after* the lock was already compromised.
- Hale entered Lab 3, not Storage — her path doesn't straightforwardly lead to the sample.
- The audio suggests someone was trying to *stop* an action, not perform one.

That said, Hale's loss of signal and the "unknown credentials" could point to Hale using a secondary credential set — this can't be ruled out.

**3. The single most resolving piece of information**

> **The identity behind the override credentials used at 19:50.**

Everything else is circumstantial. If the override credentials are traced to a specific person or access card, responsibility for the containment breach — and almost certainly for Sample 7B — follows directly. All other ambiguities (Hale's location, Reed's timeline, the door cycle) become secondary once the person who bypassed the lock is identified.
