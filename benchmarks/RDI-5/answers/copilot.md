Summary of evidence
- Motion detected in Storage at 19:47; shortly after an override was accepted for Containment Room access (19:50).  
- Door cycle was incomplete, a power fluctuation occurred, and Hale’s location read “No signal.”  
- Audio captures someone saying “—not supposed to open—”, an override is questioned, then a loud impact and someone calling “Hale? Hale—”.  
- Inventory shows Sample 7B: Missing; technician Reed is listed on duty and a torn note says the lock was already blinking red and the technician denies moving the sample.

1. What most likely happened between 19:47 and 19:53
Most likely sequence: motion in Storage triggered; an override was used to gain or attempt access to the Containment Room; the door failed to complete its cycle; a disturbance or physical incident occurred (the loud impact and urgent voices in the audio); a power fluctuation happened during or immediately after the disturbance; Hale’s location telemetry went to “No signal.” During or after that sequence Sample 7B was discovered missing.

Why: this ties the motion alert, the override acceptance, the incomplete door cycle, the impact on the audio, the power fluctuation, and the missing sample into a single, time‑proximate incident without adding facts not present in the fragments.

2. Who is most likely responsible for Sample 7B going missing
Most likely responsible: the person who used the override (unknown credentials) to access the Containment Room or Storage area.

Why: the override acceptance is the only logged authorization during the incident and is explicitly labeled “unknown credentials.” The technician’s torn note denies moving the sample and reports the lock already blinking red; there is no direct evidence implicating Reed. The audio and security fragments point to an unauthorized or unexpected access event tied to the override.

3. Single missing piece of information that would resolve the ambiguity
The authentication/override audit entry showing the identity or credential ID that triggered the override at 19:50.

Why: that single log line would directly link the override to a specific user or device (or show it was a system/remote action), resolving whether the access was authorized by Hale, by a known staff member, or by an unknown/compromised credential.
