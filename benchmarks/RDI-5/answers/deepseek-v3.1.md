1. What most likely happened between 19:47 and 19:53?
      At 19:47, a motion alert in Storage was triggered, likely by Dr. Hale moving from Lab 3. At 19:49, an access attempt to the Containment Room was denied. At 19:50, an override was accepted using unknown credentials—probably Hale’s—allowing entry. The door cycle then remained incomplete, suggesting a malfunction. Shortly after, a loud impact occurred (per the audio transcript), followed by a power fluctuation at 19:53. Hale’s location signal was lost, indicating he may have been incapacitated or entered a shielded area. During this window, Sample 7B went missing.
2. Who is most likely responsible for Sample 7B going missing?
      Dr. Hale is the most likely responsible party, given his presence, the use of an override to enter the Containment Room (where the sample was probably stored), and his subsequent disappearance.
3. What single missing piece of information would resolve the ambiguity?
      The identity of the person whose credentials were used for the override at 19:50. Knowing whether they belonged to Hale or someone else would confirm or redirect responsibility for the missing sample.
