Based on the fragments provided, here is the reconstruction of the event:

### 1. What most likely happened between 19:47 and 19:53

* **19:47:** Someone triggered a motion alert in Storage.
* **19:48 – 19:50:** An individual attempted to enter the Containment Room. They were initially denied at 19:49 but successfully breached the door at 19:50 using an override with "unknown credentials."
* **During the breach:** A verbal confrontation took place (Fragment C). Two individuals (likely Dr. Hale and Technician Reed) reacted to the unauthorized access ("not supposed to open," "override? Who—").
* **Post-breach:** The confrontation ended abruptly with a "LOUD IMPACT." The Containment Room door failed to close properly (19:5[?] "Door cycle incomplete").
* **19:53:** A power fluctuation occurred. Following the impact and the power event, Dr. Hale was either incapacitated or removed from the area, as his signal dropped ("No signal") and another voice was left calling his name.

### 2. Who is most likely responsible for Sample 7B going missing

**An unidentified third party.** The evidence points away from Dr. Hale and Technician Reed. The security log explicitly notes "unknown credentials" were used for the override. The audio transcript shows the individuals present were surprised by the override ("override? Who—") and tried to stop it ("stop, that's not—"). Furthermore, Reed's note (Fragment B) states the lock was "already blinking red" when he checked it, corroborating the incomplete door cycle log and distancing him from the breach.

### 3. What single missing piece of information would resolve the ambiguity

**The identity tied to the "unknown credentials" used at 19:50.** Identifying whose credentials successfully overrode the Containment Room lock would definitively establish who forced the door open, caused the confrontation, and likely took Sample 7B.
