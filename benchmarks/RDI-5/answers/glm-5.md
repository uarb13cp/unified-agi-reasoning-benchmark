Based on the provided fragments, here is the reconstruction of the event:

**1. What most likely happened between 19:47 and 19:53**
Dr. Hale, whose presence was unexpected (Fragment B), moved from the entrance to Storage (triggering the motion alert at 19:47). He then attempted to access the "Containment Room" (19:49) but was denied entry. Using an override code—which registered as "unknown credentials" due to corruption, masking, or unauthorized use—he successfully opened the door (19:50). A confrontation ensued inside or at the threshold, evidenced by the audio log indicating surprise at the override ("Who—") and a warning ("not supposed to open"), followed by a loud impact. The confrontation resulted in the door failing to seal (Fragment B/A), a power fluctuation, Dr. Hale’s tracker losing signal, and the disappearance of Sample 7B.

**2. Who is most likely responsible for Sample 7B going missing**
**Dr. Hale.**
*   **Opportunity:** He was present in the facility late at night when the technician did not expect him.
*   **Action:** The security log shows a progression of access attempts ending in an override to the Containment Room, the location of the samples.
*   **Corroboration:** The technician (Reed) explicitly denies moving the sample and notes the lock was already compromised, while the audio log suggests a third party (the person checking on Hale) found Hale unresponsive or incapacitated after the incident, implying Hale was the active agent during the breach.

**3. What single missing piece of information would resolve the ambiguity**
**The specific user identification associated with the "unknown credentials" override at 19:50.**
Knowing whose credentials opened the door would definitively prove whether Dr. Hale accessed the room intentionally (confirming his guilt), if a third party accessed it (suggesting an intruder), or if the credentials were spoofed/fabricated. This piece of data links the physical presence to the security breach.
