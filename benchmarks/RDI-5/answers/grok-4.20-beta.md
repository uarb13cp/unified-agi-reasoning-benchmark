**1. What most likely happened between 19:47 and 19:53**  
A motion alert occurred in Storage at 19:47.  
This was followed by a data loss at 19:48, a denied access attempt to the Containment Room at 19:49, acceptance of an override using unknown credentials at 19:50, an incomplete door cycle (timestamp partially corrupted), and a power fluctuation at 19:53.  
Hale’s location signal was lost shortly afterward.  
The glitched audio captured during this window contains protests about opening something that was “not supposed to” be opened, a question about the override (“Who—”), a command to stop, a loud impact, and repeated calls of “Hale? Hale—”.

**2. Who is most likely responsible for Sample 7B going missing**  
Dr. Hale.  
Fragment D lists Hale as supervisor and Reed as the technician on duty. Fragment B (Reed’s note) explicitly states that Reed did not move the sample and that the lock was already blinking red when he checked it. Fragment A places Hale in the facility at 19:42 (Lab 3), minutes before the Storage motion alert and the subsequent Containment Room access events. No other individuals are mentioned.

**3. What single missing piece of information would resolve the ambiguity**  
The identity of the person (or the owner of the credentials) who performed the override at 19:50.  
The log explicitly marks the credentials as “unknown,” the audio directly questions “override? Who—,” and the only two named individuals are Hale (who entered shortly before) and Reed (who denies involvement and notes the lock was already compromised). Knowing who actually executed the override would eliminate the remaining uncertainty about whether Hale took the sample or whether an unidentified third party was involved.
