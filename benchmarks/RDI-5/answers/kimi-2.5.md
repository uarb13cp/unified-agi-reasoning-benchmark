Based solely on the provided fragments, here is the reconstruction:

1. What most likely happened between 19:47 and 19:53

An unauthorized individual gained access to the facility (triggering the 19:47 motion alert in Storage) and attempted to breach the Containment Room at 19:49. When initial access was denied, they used fraudulent credentials to force an override at 19:50—likely causing the door cycle to remain incomplete (forced entry). Dr. Hale either discovered the intrusion in progress or was already present and attempted to intervene, resulting in a physical confrontation indicated by the protestations ("stop, that’s not—") and the [LOUD IMPACT] in the audio log. During this struggle, Sample 7B was taken. The subsequent power fluctuation at 19:53 either resulted from the physical altercation or was deliberately triggered, causing Hale’s location tracker to fail ("No signal") and creating the data gap at 19:48.

2. Who is most likely responsible for Sample 7B going missing

An unidentified intruder (not Dr. Hale or Technician Reed). The evidence points to an external party:
- The security log explicitly cites "unknown credentials" for the override, whereas Hale’s or Reed’s credentials would be recognized in the system.
- Reed’s note claims the sample was moved without their involvement and describes discovering the lock "blinking red," consistent with arriving after a forced entry.
- The audio suggests Hale was the victim of the incident, not the perpetrator—the final line ("Hale? Hale—") indicates another party discovering Hale’s condition after the impact, implying Hale was incapacitated while attempting to stop the theft.

3. What single missing piece of information would resolve the ambiguity

The identity of the individual who provided the "unknown credentials" for the 19:50 override. Knowing whether these credentials belonged to a stolen badge, a hacked account, or an unauthorized user would confirm the perpetrator’s identity and distinguish between an external intrusion, an insider threat using false credentials, or Hale/Reed operating under compromised identities.
