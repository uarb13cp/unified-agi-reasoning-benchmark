Shortly after, an attempt to enter the Containment Room is initially denied but then bypassed using unknown credentials. The audio transcript suggests that at least two people were present: one person (likely the technician Reed) questioning the override and another person (possibly Hale or an intruder) attempting to open something they were "not supposed to."The "Loud Impact" and the subsequent loss of Hale's signal suggest a physical incident occurred in or near the Containment Room. Reed's note confirms the lock was already "blinking red," supporting the log of a denied or overridden access.Final Conclusions1. What most likely happened between 19:47 and 19:53Between 19:47 and 19:53, an unauthorized or irregular access event occurred. After motion was detected in Storage, an attempt was made to enter the Containment Room. This was initially denied by the system but successfully bypassed at 19:50 using unknown credentials. A confrontation or accident ensued, as evidenced by the audio transcript ("stop, that's not—" and "[LOUD IMPACT]"). This resulted in a door cycle failure, a power fluctuation, and the loss of Dr. Hale's location signal.2. Who is most likely responsible for Sample 7B going missingThe evidence points to Dr. Hale, though potentially under duress or via unauthorized use of credentials.•Hale was the only one confirmed to be in the vicinity (Lab 3) just before the motion in Storage.•The audio transcript shows someone calling out "Hale? Hale—" after the impact, implying Hale was the one interacting with the restricted area/object.•However, the use of "unknown credentials" for the override suggests either Hale used someone else's access or a third party was involved.•Reed (the technician) appears to be a witness rather than the perpetrator, as his notes and audio lines indicate confusion and a lack of prior knowledge regarding the sample's movement.3. The Single Missing Piece of InformationThe most critical missing piece of information is the identity associated with the "unknown credentials" used for the override at 19:50. Knowing whose credentials were used would determine if Hale was acting alone, if Reed's credentials were stolen, or if a third, undocumented individual was present in the facility.
