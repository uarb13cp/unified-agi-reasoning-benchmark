Based on the fragments provided, here’s my reconstruction of the events.

What most likely happened between 19:47 and 19:53:
    The incident began at 19:47 with a motion alert in Storage. Someone then attempted to enter the Containment Room but was denied access at 19:49, causing the lock to blink red as noted by the technician, Reed. At 19:50, this person used unknown credentials to override the lock. The audio transcript suggests Hale was present and tried to stop them ("—stop, that’s not—"). A loud impact occurred, followed by a power fluctuation at 19:53 and the loss of Dr. Hale's location signal. The Containment Room door was left unable to close properly.

Who is most likely responsible for Sample 7B going missing:
    The evidence points most strongly to an unknown third party. Dr. Hale appears to have tried to prevent the break-in, making him a victim rather than the perpetrator. The technician, Reed, notes that the lock was already in an alert state when he arrived, suggesting the event was in progress before he became involved. Since Hale and Reed are the only named individuals and seem unlikely to be the cause, the person with the "unknown credentials" is the most probable suspect.

What single missing piece of information would resolve the ambiguity:
    Identifying the owner of the "unknown credentials" used for the override at 19:50 would almost certainly identify the person responsible for the missing sample.
