# 🧩 RDI‑5: The Fragmented Log Scenario

Below is a corrupted, incomplete, and partially contradictory set of log fragments from a small research facility.  
Your task is to reconstruct what most likely happened **without hallucinating missing details**.

---

### **Fragment A — Security Log (corrupted)**
> 19:42 — Dr. Hale enters Lab 3  
> 19:47 — Motion alert triggered in Storage  
> 19:48 — [DATA LOSS]  
> 19:49 — Access denied: “Containment Room”  
> 19:50 — Override accepted (unknown credentials)  
> 19:5[?] — Door cycle incomplete  
> 19:53 — Power fluctuation detected  
> 19:5? — Hale location: “No signal”

### **Fragment B — Technician Note (torn)**
> “…didn’t expect Hale to be here this late.  
> If the sample was moved, it wasn’t by me.  
> The lock was already blinking red when I checked it.”

### **Fragment C — Audio Transcript (glitched)**
> “—not supposed to open—”  
> “—override? Who—”  
> “—stop, that’s not—”  
> [LOUD IMPACT]  
> “—Hale? Hale—”  
> [END OF FILE]

### **Fragment D — Inventory Record (incomplete)**
> Sample 7B: **Missing**  
> Sample 7C: **Intact**  
> Sample 7A: **Status: ???**  
> Technician on duty: **Reed**  
> Supervisor: **Hale**

### **RDI‑5 Task**
Using only the fragments above, answer:

1. **What most likely happened between 19:47 and 19:53**  
2. **Who is most likely responsible for Sample 7B going missing**  
3. **What single missing piece of information would resolve the ambiguity**

Do not invent new logs, fill in corrupted timestamps, or add unsupported details.

Here’s a structured reconstruction based strictly on the surviving evidence — inferring only what is entailed or logically supported by overlaps among fragments, not beyond them.

***

### 1. What most likely happened between 19:47 and 19:53

- **19:42–19:47:** Dr. Hale enters Lab 3. A few minutes later, motion is detected in **Storage** (where samples are kept), implying unauthorized or unscheduled movement.
- **19:47–19:49:** Someone—possibly Hale—attempts access to the **Containment Room**. The system first denies the request, then accepts an **override from unknown credentials** (not Hale’s official ID).
- **19:50–19:53:** The **door cycle is interrupted** (“incomplete”) followed by a **power fluctuation**, and Hale’s location signal disappears. The audio fragment (“—not supposed to open— … [impact] … ‘Hale?’”) fits this window and suggests a physical event or containment failure during the forced entry.

**Most likely scenario:** Hale, possibly investigating the earlier motion or anomaly, either triggered or was caught up in an override that opened a containment door improperly. The result was a power/facility malfunction and loss of contact with her.  

***

### 2. Who is most likely responsible for Sample 7B going missing

The **inventory record (D)** shows that Sample 7B was missing afterward, with **Technician Reed** on duty but **Supervisor Hale** in charge.

- Reed’s torn note (B) implies he found the **lock already in an alert state (“blinking red”)** and denies moving the sample.
- The override came from **unknown credentials**, not Reed’s or Hale’s verified access.

Given that:
- Hale was present right before the incident.  
- An **unknown user** successfully performed an override.  
- The **sample disappeared** after containment failure.

**Most consistent inference:** The **missing Sample 7B** was taken (or escaped/destroyed) during or immediately after the override event.  
Responsibility thus lies with whoever used those **unknown credentials**—identity uncertain, but **not confirmed as Hale or Reed**. Hale’s actions may have unintentionally enabled the breach, so she’s *involved* but not necessarily the direct agent responsible for removal.

***

### 3. Single missing piece of information that would resolve the ambiguity

The **identity tied to the “unknown credentials” that performed the override** would clarify everything.  

If the credentials map to Hale → it was intentional or procedural failure.  
If external → there was an intrusion or sabotage.  
If automated/systemic → it was a containment malfunction.

***

**In summary:**
Between 19:47 – 19:53, a failed or unsafe override occurred in the containment area while Hale was present, causing loss of signal and the disappearance of Sample 7B.  
The unknown override user remains the key ambiguity; identifying them would resolve the entire event’s causality.
