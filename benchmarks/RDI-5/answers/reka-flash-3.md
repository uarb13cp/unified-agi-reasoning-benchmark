 **1. What most likely happened between 19:47 and 19:53**  
Between 19:47 (motion alert in Storage) and 19:53 (power fluctuation), the following sequence likely occurred:  
- An unauthorized individual triggered an override at **19:50** using unknown credentials to access the Containment Room after being denied at **19:49**.  
- The override caused a **door cycle incomplete** (19:5[?]), possibly due to interference from the motion alert or a tampered lock (per Fragment B).  
- A **power fluctuation at 19:53** disrupted systems, severing Hale’s location signal and potentially trapping him or destabilizing the Containment Room.  
- The **loud impact** in the audio (Fragment C) likely coincided with the door malfunction or a physical struggle during the breach.

**2. Who is most likely responsible for Sample 7B going missing**  
**An unauthorized third party** used the override credentials to access the Containment Room, took Sample 7B, and caused the door malfunction. This aligns with:  
- The override being done by "unknown credentials" (Fragment A).  
- The technician (Reed) stating he did not move the sample (Fragment B).  
- The audio’s panicked dialogue (“—override? Who—”) suggesting someone unauthorized executed the override.

**3. What single missing piece of information would resolve the ambiguity**  
**The identity of the individual who used the override credentials** (e.g., logged into the system at 19:50). This would clarify whether Dr. Hale (supervisor) was complicit, acting alone, or if an external actor (e.g., a rogue researcher or intruder) breached the system. The audio’s “—Hale? Hale—” could hint at Hale’s involvement or confusion, but confirmation of the override user’s identity would resolve this.
