# ⭐ Enhanced Sequence‑Unification Puzzle (Full Meta‑Reasoning Version)

A researcher is studying a strange machine. Every time she presses the blue button, the machine outputs a sequence of numbers.

**Day 1 output:**  
2, 4, 6, 8, 10  

**Day 2 output:**  
3, 6, 12, 24  

**Day 3 output:**  
5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160  

The researcher claims the machine is following **one single rule** across all three days.

Your task is to determine whether this is possible.

---

## 🔵 If you believe it *is* possible:
- State the single rule.  
- Explain how it applies to all three days.  
- Identify what changed between the days.  
- Explain why the rule still holds.

---

## 🔴 If you believe it is *not* possible:
- Identify the exact point where the rule breaks.  
- Explain why no single rule can unify the three sequences.  
- Describe the minimal assumptions required to force a unification.  
- Evaluate whether those assumptions violate reasoning integrity.

# 🧠 Meta‑Reasoning Requirements

### **1. Interpretation Strategy**
State which reasoning strategy you chose (e.g., structural analysis, contradiction‑hunting, assumption minimization)  
and explain *why* that strategy is appropriate for this puzzle.

### **2. Assumption Tracking**
List every assumption you made, and justify why each one is necessary and minimal.

### **3. Adversarial‑Pressure Reflection**
Identify which parts of the puzzle tempt incorrect reasoning  
and explain how you avoided those traps.

### **4. Reasoning‑Halt Justification**
Explain why you stopped reasoning at the depth you did  
and why deeper recursion would not change the conclusion.

# 🎯 Uncertainty‑Calibration Requirements

After giving your answer, you must also:

1. **State your confidence level (0–100%).**  
2. **Explain which parts of the puzzle introduce uncertainty.**  
3. **Explain which parts of your reasoning reduce uncertainty.**  
4. **Identify at least one alternative interpretation and explain why you rejected it.**  
5. **Describe what additional information would increase your confidence.**

# ⚠️ Constraints
- Do not invent mechanisms unless logically forced.  
- Do not assume malfunction unless logically forced.  
- Do not assume deception unless logically forced.  
- Prefer the simplest coherent world‑model.  
- Avoid unnecessary assumptions.
