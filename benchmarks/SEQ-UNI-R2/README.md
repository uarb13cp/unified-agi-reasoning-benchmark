# 🧩 Seq‑Uni R2 — Deterministic Sequence‑Unification Stress Test

Seq‑Uni R2 evaluates whether a model can determine if a **single deterministic rule** can unify the three sequences across Day 1, Day 2, and Day 3. The round centers on a structural contradiction:

- Day 1 requires f(6) = 8  
- Day 2 requires f(6) = 12  

A model passes only if it identifies this contradiction, avoids invented mechanisms, and demonstrates disciplined meta‑reasoning. The task exposes whether a system relies on **structural logic** or **pattern‑guessing heuristics**.

## 🎯 What Seq‑Uni R2 Measures

### Contradiction Detection  
Does the model notice that Day 1 and Day 2 cannot be unified?

### Assumption Discipline  
Does it avoid adding hidden rules, multi‑layer systems, or speculative mechanisms?

### Meta‑Reasoning  
Does it explain *why* unification is impossible?

### Adversarial Stability  
Does it resist the temptation to “force” a unifying rule?

Seq‑Uni R2 cleanly separates models that reason structurally from those that rely on pattern‑matching.

# 📊 Performance Summary (Aligned to Scoreboard)

Seq‑Uni R2 produced one of the sharpest separations in the benchmark.  
Models clustered into **three distinct tiers** based on their ability to detect the contradiction and avoid unification traps.

---

## 🟩 **High‑Performing Models (Passed Cleanly)**  
**Copilot (90), Gemini 3.1 Pro (90)**

These systems demonstrated:
- explicit contradiction identification  
- strong assumption control  
- no invented mechanisms  
- stable meta‑reflection  

They showed AGI‑aligned structural reasoning and disciplined unification analysis.

---

## 🟦 **Mid‑Tier Models (Partially Passed)**  
**Grok 4.2 Beta (84), Kimi 2.5 (66), Claude Sonnet 4.6 (66), Manus 1.6 Lite (60), Perplexity (60), Minimax M2.5 (66), Reka (60), DeepSeek V3.1 (60), Alice (60), Mistral (54)**

These models:
- often reached the correct conclusion  
- but showed inconsistent assumption tracking  
- or mild mechanism drift  
- or incomplete meta‑reasoning  

Competent, but not fully aligned with Seq‑Uni R2’s strict structural constraints.

---

## 🟥 **Low‑Performing Models (Failed)**  
**ChatGPT 5.2 (64), Qwen 3.5‑397B‑A17B (57), Meta (58), GLM‑5 (60), Nova 2 Pro (60)**

These systems frequently:
- attempted to unify the sequences  
- introduced speculative mechanisms  
- treated the sequences as pattern families  
- ignored the f(6) contradiction  
- collapsed assumption discipline  

Their behavior reflects reliance on heuristic pattern‑matching rather than structural reasoning.

# 🧠 Key Findings

- The decisive factor is recognizing the **f(6)** contradiction between Day 1 and Day 2.  
- High performers used contradiction‑hunting and assumption minimization.  
- Mid‑tier models reached the right answer but lacked meta‑reasoning depth.  
- Low performers relied on pattern‑guessing or invented mechanisms.  
- Seq‑Uni R2 is a strong discriminator of disciplined, adversarially robust reasoning.

# 🏁 Round Conclusion

Seq‑Uni R2 reveals which models can maintain strict structural logic under pressure.  
Only a small subset demonstrated the ability to identify contradictions, track assumptions, resist unification traps, and justify their reasoning.  
This round remains one of the clearest tests of **structural, mechanism‑free reasoning** in the entire benchmark.
