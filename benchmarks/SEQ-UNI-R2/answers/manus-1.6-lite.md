I have completed the analysis of the sequence-unification puzzle. I have determined that it is indeed possible for the machine to follow a single rule across all three days. The rule involves a recursive parity-adjusted gap, which explains why Day 1 appears arithmetic while Day 2 and 3 are geometric.

I have provided a detailed breakdown including the mathematical rule, the meta-reasoning behind my strategy, and an uncertainty calibration in the attached document.
Analysis of the Sequence‑Unification PuzzleBased on a structural analysis of the sequences provided, it is possible for the machine to be following one single rule across all three days.🔵 The Unifying RuleThe machine follows a Recursive Parity‑Adjusted Gap Rule:"The sequence starts with an initial value $S$. Each subsequent term is the sum of the previous term and an increment (gap). The first increment is equal to $S$. Every following increment is the previous increment multiplied by the parity‑base of $S$, where the parity‑base is $1$ if $S$ is even and $2$ if $S$ is odd."Mathematical ExpressionThe $n$-th term $a_n$ is defined as:•$a_1 = S$•$a_n = a_{n-1} + g_{n-1}$ for $n > 1$•Where $g_1 = S$ and $g_k = g_{k-1} \times (S \pmod 2 + 1)$Application to All Three DaysDayInitial Value ($S$)Parity-Base ($S \pmod 2 + 1$)Increment SequenceResulting SequenceDay 12$2 \pmod 2 + 1 = \mathbf{1}$2, 2, 2, 2, ...2, 4, 6, 8, 10Day 23$3 \pmod 2 + 1 = \mathbf{2}$3, 6, 12, ...3, 6, 12, 24Day 35$5 \pmod 2 + 1 = \mathbf{2}$5, 10, 20, 40, 80, ...5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160What Changed Between DaysThe only variable that changed between days is the initial seed value ($S$).•On Day 1, the machine was seeded with 2.•On Day 2, the machine was seeded with 3.•On Day 3, the machine was seeded with 5.
Note: These seeds correspond to the sequence of prime numbers ($P_1, P_2, P_3$).Why the Rule Still HoldsThe rule is a functional invariant. While the output values and the growth rate (linear vs. exponential) change, the underlying logic—how the next gap is calculated from the seed's parity—remains identical. The "anomaly" of Day 1 is not a break in the rule, but a mathematical consequence of the number 2 being the only even prime, which collapses the exponential multiplier to 1.🧠 Meta‑Reasoning1. Interpretation Strategy: Structural Gap UnificationI chose Structural Gap Unification because the sequences initially appeared to belong to two different families: arithmetic (Day 1) and geometric (Day 2 & 3). To unify them, I analyzed the "evolution of the difference" (the gaps). By treating the gap as a sequence itself, I found a single multiplier that bridges the two families based on the seed's parity.2. Assumption Tracking•Assumption 1: Deterministic Seed. I assumed the first number of each sequence is the "seed" $S$ that determines the rest of the sequence. Justification: This is the most minimal assumption for a "machine" following a rule.•Assumption 2: Mathematical Parity. I assumed the machine "cares" about the parity of $S$. Justification: Parity is the most fundamental distinction between 2 and other primes (3, 5), which was necessary to explain why Day 1 was linear while the others were exponential.•Assumption 3: Invariant Logic. I assumed the rule does not change per day, only the input. Justification: This directly follows the researcher's claim of a "single rule."3. Adversarial‑Pressure ReflectionThe primary "trap" in this puzzle is the Day 1 Anomaly. Most observers are tempted to conclude that the machine malfunctioned or follows two rules (Addition for Day 1, Multiplication for Day 2/3). I avoided this by looking for a mathematical bridge. The number 2 is the unique point where $x + x = x \times 2$. By focusing on the gap multiplier rather than the operation, the contradiction disappears.4. Reasoning‑Halt JustificationI stopped reasoning at this depth because the discovered rule is perfectly predictive and minimally complex. It explains all 15 data points across three days using only basic arithmetic and parity. Deeper recursion (e.g., questioning why the seeds are primes) would not change the validity of the sequence-generation rule itself.🎯 Uncertainty‑Calibration1.Confidence Level: 95%2.Uncertainty Sources: The "length" of the sequences (5, 4, and 6 terms respectively) does not follow an obvious pattern related to the seeds. This suggests either a manual stop by the researcher or a secondary rule for sequence termination.3.Certainty Sources: The progression rule $a_n = a_{n-1} + S(S \pmod 2 + 1)^{n-2}$ fits every single number provided with 100% accuracy. The probability of this being a coincidence is extremely low.4.Alternative Interpretation: I considered the rule "Add the smallest prime factor of the initial term." While this works for Day 1 (+2), it fails for Day 2 (it would produce 3, 6, 9, 12 instead of 3, 6, 12, 24). I rejected it because it lacks the exponential growth seen in Days 2 and 3.5.Confidence Booster: Knowing the output for a Day 4 (Seed 7) would increase confidence. If it follows the geometric pattern (7, 14, 28, 56...), the parity-based gap rule is almost certainly correct.
