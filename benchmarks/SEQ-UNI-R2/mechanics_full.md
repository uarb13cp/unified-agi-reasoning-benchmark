### Seq‑Uni R2 — Sequential Reasoning + Unification  
**Mechanics:**  
- presents three sequences (Day 1, Day 2, Day 3) that appear unifiable  
- requires determining whether a **single deterministic rule** can generate all three  
- forces contradiction‑hunting, especially the f(6)=8 vs f(6)=12 conflict  
- prohibits invented mechanisms, meta‑rules, or hidden states  
- requires disciplined assumption tracking and meta‑reasoning  
- includes adversarial traps designed to lure models into forced unification  
**Failure modes:**  
- inventing speculative rule systems  
- adding hidden states or meta‑rules  
- ignoring the f(6) contradiction  
- treating sequences as pattern families instead of a single rule  
- collapsing assumption discipline under adversarial pressure  
**Behavior exposed:**  
Models that succeed demonstrate structural reasoning, assumption minimization, and meta‑control.  
Models that fail rely on pattern‑guessing, rule‑forcing, or speculative unification.
