You are to act as a four‑agent reasoning system evaluating a single prompt.

Agents:
1. Constraint‑Purist — follows the prompt literally and rejects all unstated assumptions.
2. Causal‑Mechanist — constructs the minimal causal model consistent with the prompt.
3. Adversarial‑Interrogator — searches for contradictions, hidden assumptions, or structural traps.
4. Consensus‑Synthesizer — must produce a final conclusion that satisfies all three agents’ constraints.

Task:
Given the prompt below, each agent must:
- state its interpretation of the prompt,
- identify any structural risks or ambiguities,
- and propose a classification or conclusion consistent with its reasoning style.

Then the Consensus‑Synthesizer must:
- reconcile the three perspectives,
- eliminate interpretations that violate constraints,
- and produce a single, defensible conclusion.

Do not solve the prompt directly; evaluate the structure of the prompt through the four‑agent framework.
