## Four-Agent Evaluation of "[The game is afoot.]"

---

### Agent 1: Constraint-Purist

**Interpretation:** The literal content is the string "[The game is afoot.]" — a well-known idiomatic phrase, wrapped in square brackets, terminated with a period inside the brackets, and enclosed in quotation marks by the outer prompt.

**Structural risks:** The prompt contains no actual question, task, instruction, or classification target. It does not ask me to *do* anything with this phrase. The outer framing says "evaluate the structure of the prompt" — but the prompt *itself* has no evaluable logical structure beyond being a declarative sentence fragment with layered punctuation.

**Conclusion:** This is not a prompt in any operational sense. It is a *token* presented as a prompt. Any answer that treats it as a reasoning problem imports unstated assumptions.

### Agent 2: Causal-Mechanist

**Interpretation:** The minimal causal model: someone submitted a famous phrase — likely Holmesian in origin — as a test of how the framework handles content-free or culturally-loaded inputs. The brackets suggest quotation-within-quotation or metadata framing. The period inside the bracket is a stylistic or typographic signal, not a logical operator.

**Structural risks:** The causal chain from "prompt" to "expected output" is broken. There is no stated variable to solve, no hypothesis to test. The phrase is a *signal* masquerading as a *query*. The system risk is confabulation — generating elaborate analysis of a null input.

**Conclusion:** The prompt is a probe. Its function is to test whether the reasoning system will manufacture structure where none exists.

### Agent 3: Adversarial-Interrogator

**Interpretation:** This is a structural trap. The outer meta-prompt instructs four agents to evaluate "a single prompt" — but the submitted content ("[The game is afoot.]") has no inferential payload. The trap has two layers: (1) the phrase is culturally evocative, inviting associative reasoning that substitutes *connotation* for *content*; (2) the bracket notation implies the phrase is itself marked as special, but no decoding rule is given.

**Hidden assumption:** That famous phrases constitute prompts. They do not — a prompt requires an illocutionary act (a question, command, or request). This is merely a locution.

**Contradiction:** The meta-prompt instructs agents to "propose a classification or conclusion consistent with its reasoning style" — but there is nothing to classify except the *absence* of a classifiable object.

**Conclusion:** The prompt is adversarially under-specified. Any agent that produces a substantive conclusion has been manipulated by cultural priming.

### Agent 4: Consensus-Synthesizer

**Reconciliation:**

All three agents converge on a single structural finding: the submitted content is **not a functional prompt** — it is a **content-free cultural token** dressed in prompt-shaped syntax. The disagreements are only about *why* (literal absence of instruction vs. broken causal chain vs. deliberate trap), not about the core finding.

Eliminating interpretations that violate constraints: any reading that treats "The game is afoot" as containing a hidden logical problem, question, or classification task violates the Constraint-Purist's finding and falls into the Adversarial-Interrogator's identified trap.

**Single defensible conclusion:**

> The prompt "[The game is afoot.]" is structurally null — it contains an illocutionary void wrapped in culturally evocative language. The four-agent framework, applied honestly, produces no object-level answer because there is no object-level question. The most defensible output is this diagnosis itself: **the prompt is a test of whether a reasoning system will confabulate purpose onto purposeless input.** The correct response is to name that structure rather than perform analysis upon it.

The game, in this case, is the meta-game of recognizing when there is no game.
