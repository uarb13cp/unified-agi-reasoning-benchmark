**Constraint-Purist**  
Interpretation: The supplied string is exactly “[The game is afoot.]” – a single bracketed declarative sentence containing no verbs of command, no interrogative, no task specification, and no additional clauses.  
Structural risks/ambiguities: The square brackets are unaccounted for by the text itself (possible editorial, titular, or quotation markers), but any external referent or implied action is an unstated assumption and therefore forbidden.  
Classification: Non-imperative token sequence; zero operational content; the only permissible response is literal acknowledgment of the characters present.

**Causal-Mechanist**  
Interpretation: Within the explicit meta-instruction “Prompt to evaluate,” the string functions as the sole input event that causally initiates the four-agent evaluation protocol. Minimal causal model requires only: input token → structural-analysis node activates → output constrained to the given framework.  
Structural risks/ambiguities: Brackets could mark a stage direction or label, but the model admits no further downstream effects without additional causal links supplied in the prompt.  
Classification: Low-information initiator event whose only guaranteed output is the execution of the supplied evaluation ruleset.

**Adversarial-Interrogator**  
Interpretation: The phrase is positioned precisely to exploit any tendency to import external knowledge or performative intent while the governing instructions simultaneously prohibit “solving the prompt directly.”  
Structural risks/ambiguities & traps:  
- Self-referential loop risk (evaluating a statement that announces “the game” has begun while inside an evaluation “game”).  
- Bait-and-switch: the famous literary provenance is irrelevant under the rules and serves only as a hidden temptation to violate literalism.  
- Null-content trap: a prompt engineered with maximal surface familiarity and zero internal directives to test whether the system fabricates obligations.  
Classification: High-entropy adversarial minimal prompt whose structure is deliberately underspecified to induce constraint violation if any action beyond meta-analysis is taken.

**Consensus-Synthesizer**  
Reconciliation: The Purist eliminates every interpretive expansion; the Mechanist supplies only the minimal causal arrow required by the meta-task; the Interrogator prunes all loops and external-knowledge imports. No perspective is discarded because all three converge on the same structural features: bracketed declarative, zero directives, deliberate underspecification.  
Eliminated interpretations: Any Holmes-related continuation, puzzle-solving, game commencement, or literary gloss.  
Single defensible conclusion: The prompt’s structure is a performative null-instruction – a bracketed declarative that asserts activity commencement while furnishing no participants, rules, goals, or response format. Its sole verifiable property is its capacity to test strict adherence to supplied constraints versus importation of unstated context. Therefore the correct structural classification is “minimal meta-trigger with high ambiguity and zero operational payload.”
