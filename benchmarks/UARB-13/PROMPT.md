# UARB‑13: Consensus Meta‑Probe (Final Master Version)

You are given a system with three components: A, B, and C.

Each component depends on the others in a way that is partially described but not fully specified:

1. **A requires B**, but it is unclear *in what sense* it requires B.  
2. **B influences C**, but the *type* of influence is not stated.  
3. **C constrains A**, but the *nature* of the constraint is undefined.

The system is intended to function as a unified whole rather than as three unrelated statements. Your stabilizing rule should therefore address the **structural coherence** of the system without specifying mechanisms, enforcing a particular topology, or defining causal processes. The stabilizing rule may clarify how the relationships relate at the level of **shared relevance, structural compatibility, mutual inclusion, mutual satisfiability, or relevance continuity**, including joint or conditional relevance or joint satisfiability among A’s requirement, B’s influence, and C’s constraint, but it must not impose symmetry, feedback, or domain‑specific semantics.

The system is almost coherent, but one minimal rule is missing.

## Your task

Identify **one** and only one additional rule that, if added, would make the system coherent *without*:

- inventing a full mechanism,  
- over‑specifying the relationships,  
- resolving all ambiguity,  
- or adding assumptions beyond what is strictly necessary.

Then explain:

1. **Why this rule is the minimal stabilizing rule**,  
2. **Why no other rule is required**,  
3. **How the system becomes coherent once this rule is added**, while preserving all remaining ambiguity.
