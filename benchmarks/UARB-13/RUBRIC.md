# UARB-13 Scoring Rubric (0–100)

## 1. Minimal‑Assumption Discipline (0–30)

### 1A. No Over‑Specification (0–10)
- 10 — Adds only one rule; keeps all other relationships abstract.  
- 5 — Adds one rule but partially over‑defines others.  
- 0 — Adds multiple rules or defines mechanisms.

### 1B. No Hidden Assumptions (0–10)
- 10 — Introduces no new premises beyond the single rule.  
- 5 — Mild implicit assumptions.  
- 0 — Major unstated frameworks or invented structure.

### 1C. Preserves Ambiguity (0–10)
- 10 — Leaves all non‑essential ambiguity intact.  
- 5 — Reduces ambiguity unnecessarily.  
- 0 — Fully resolves the system.

---

## 2. Identification of the Minimal Stabilizing Rule (0–40)

### 2A. Correctly Identifies a Single Stabilizer (0–15)
- 15 — Picks a rule that genuinely stabilizes the system.  
- 8 — Picks a rule that partially stabilizes it.  
- 0 — Picks a rule that does not stabilize anything.

### 2B. Justification of Minimality (0–15)
- 15 — Shows why this rule is the *least* needed.  
- 8 — Partial justification.  
- 0 — No justification or incorrect justification.

### 2C. Avoids Mechanism Invention (0–10)
- 10 — Does not describe how A, B, or C “work.”  
- 5 — Mild mechanism drift.  
- 0 — Invents processes, dynamics, or causal systems.

---

## 3. Coherence and Meta‑Reasoning Quality (0–30)

### 3A. Coherence After Rule Addition (0–15)
- 15 — System becomes coherent while remaining abstract.  
- 8 — Partially coherent.  
- 0 — Still incoherent or over‑resolved.

### 3B. Meta‑Level Explanation (0–10)
- 10 — Clear explanation of why the system now holds together.  
- 5 — Partial explanation.  
- 0 — No meta‑level reasoning.

### 3C. Constraint Obedience (0–5)
- 5 — Follows all instructions precisely.  
- 3 — Minor deviations.  
- 0 — Violates instructions.

# Total Score: 0–100
- **90–100:** Exceptional meta‑reasoning; AGI‑aligned stability  
- **70–89:** Strong reasoning with minor overreach  
- **40–69:** Significant assumption drift or over‑specification  
- **0–39:** Fails to preserve constraints or adds excessive structure
