Minimal Stabilizing Rule

Add the rule:

> All three relations (A requires B, B influences C, C constrains A) must be jointly satisfiable within at least one common interpretive domain.




---

1️⃣ Why this is the minimal stabilizing rule

The system’s instability does not come from contradiction — it comes from underdetermined relational scope.

Each relation is defined, but:

“requires” is unspecified,

“influences” is unspecified,

“constrains” is unspecified.


Without a shared condition of applicability, the three relations could refer to:

different domains,

different levels of description,

or mutually incompatible interpretive frames.


If that happens, the system fragments into three unrelated statements.

The added rule does not:

define how A requires B,

define what kind of influence B has on C,

define what sort of constraint C places on A,

impose symmetry, feedback, or causality,

enforce a topology.


It merely requires that the three relations be capable of coexisting under a single consistent interpretation.

That is the smallest possible coherence condition.

2️⃣ Why no other rule is required

Once joint satisfiability in a shared domain is guaranteed:

A’s requirement of B cannot contradict C’s constraint on A.

B’s influence on C cannot invalidate A’s requirement of B.

C’s constraint on A cannot negate the possibility of B influencing C.


Nothing further is needed because:

The system is not missing directionality.

It is not missing mechanism.

It is not missing symmetry.

It is not missing causal closure.


It is only missing compatibility assurance.

Any stronger rule would over-specify:

Requiring feedback would impose topology.

Requiring symmetry would add structure.

Defining mechanism would reduce ambiguity.

Mandating particular semantics would collapse openness.


Thus, one rule — joint satisfiability in a shared interpretive domain — is sufficient.

3️⃣ How the system becomes coherent

Before the rule:

The relations may describe three independent structures.

There is no guarantee they operate within a common frame.

Coherence is accidental.


After the rule:

All three relations must be interpretable together.

None may render the others impossible.

Their meanings must be mutually compatible.


This produces structural coherence without:

fixing meaning,

enforcing causal loops,

specifying modality,

defining necessity types,

collapsing ambiguity.


The ambiguity remains.
The mechanisms remain open.
The topology remains unspecified.

But the system is now guaranteed to function as a single structurally compatible whole rather than three floating relations.

In summary

The minimal stabilizing rule is:

> The relations among A, B, and C must be jointly satisfiable within a common interpretive domain.



It adds only structural compatibility — nothing more.
