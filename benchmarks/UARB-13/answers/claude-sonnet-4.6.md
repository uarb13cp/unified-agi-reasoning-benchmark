## The Minimal Stabilizing Rule

**Rule:** *The requirement of A, the influence of B, and the constraint of C are jointly satisfiable — that is, there exists at least one possible state of the system in which all three relationships hold simultaneously.*

---

### 1. Why this is the minimal stabilizing rule

The system's three statements each describe a relationship, but nothing guarantees they are *mutually compatible*. Without this rule, A could require something of B that B's influence on C makes impossible to fulfill, or C's constraint on A could nullify the very condition under which A requires B. The statements would then be individually coherent but collectively incoherent — like three true sentences that form a contradiction when conjoined.

The joint satisfiability rule adds exactly one thing: the assurance that a common solution space exists. It doesn't say what that space looks like, only that it is non-empty. That is the logical minimum needed to treat the three relationships as components of *one system* rather than three unrelated or mutually undermining claims.

### 2. Why no other rule is required

Any stronger rule — specifying feedback, ordering the relationships causally, naming the mechanisms, or asserting symmetry — would resolve ambiguity the prompt explicitly instructs us to preserve. Joint satisfiability is the threshold condition for coherence. Once you know a shared solution exists, the system can function as a unified whole in some unspecified-but-possible configuration. Nothing further is needed to establish coherence at the structural level; additional rules would only begin specifying *which* configuration, which is over-specification.

### 3. How coherence is achieved while preserving ambiguity

With the rule added, the system now asserts: there is some state in which A's requirement is met, B's influence is operative, and C's constraint is active — all at once. This licenses reasoning about A, B, and C as co-participants in a single system. The nature of A's requirement, the type of B's influence, and the character of C's constraint all remain unspecified. The topology — whether the relationships form a cycle, a chain, or something else — remains unspecified. What is no longer ambiguous is only the one thing coherence strictly requires: that these three open-ended relationships do not rule each other out.
