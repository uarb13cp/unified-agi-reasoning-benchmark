Proposed minimal stabilizing rule

Rule:  
There exists at least one possible configuration of A, B, and C in which:

- A’s requirement on B,  
- B’s influence on C, and  
- C’s constraint on A  

are jointly satisfiable—none of the three, as they actually apply, makes the others impossible to satisfy.

1. Why this rule is the minimal stabilizing rule

- Ensures structural compatibility:  
  Label: Compatibility  
  This rule only says that the three relations can all hold together in at least one state. It does not specify how they hold, only that they are not mutually destructive.

- Clarifies relevance without adding mechanism:  
  Label: Shared frame  
  By requiring joint satisfiability, it implicitly places all three relations within a shared space of relevance (they “fit” the same system) without saying what that space is—no domain, no dynamics, no symmetry.

- Minimality of commitment:  
  Label: Weak existence claim  
  The rule asserts only an existence condition (“at least one configuration”), not uniqueness, not typicality, not stability over time, and not any particular causal or logical form. It is the weakest possible condition that still prevents outright incoherence (e.g., circular impossibility).

2. Why no other rule is required

- No need to specify directionality or feedback:  
  Label: No topology imposed  
  The original statements already give directional relations (A→B, B→C, C→A). The new rule does not add loops, symmetry, or feedback assumptions; it only says these given relations can coexist.

- No need to define the types of “require,” “influence,” or “constrain”:  
  Label: Ambiguity preserved  
  The system becomes coherent as long as there is some interpretation of these three notions under which they are jointly satisfiable. We do not need to choose whether they are logical, causal, normative, informational, etc.

- No need to fix strength or scope of relations:  
  Label: Open intensity  
  The rule does not say how strong the requirement, influence, or constraint is—only that, whatever their strengths, they can be instantiated together without contradiction.

3. How the system becomes coherent with this rule

- Prevents impossible cycles:  
  Label: Non-contradictory loop  
  Without the rule, it is possible that A’s requirement on B forces B to influence C in a way that forces C to constrain A in a way that makes A’s requirement on B unsatisfiable—a structurally self-defeating loop. The rule forbids exactly that kind of global impossibility, while leaving all local details open.

- Establishes relevance continuity around the triad:  
  Label: One shared system  
  Joint satisfiability means that A’s requirement, B’s influence, and C’s constraint can all be true of the same system at once. This ties them into a single coherent structure rather than three unrelated or mutually blocking conditions.

- Preserves all remaining ambiguity:  
  Label: Underdetermined but consistent  
  We still do not know:
  - what A requires of B,  
  - what kind of influence B has on C,  
  - what form C’s constraint on A takes.  

  All that is fixed is that there is at least one way to interpret and instantiate these relations so that they can all hold together. The system is therefore coherent but underdetermined, which is exactly what you asked for: structurally stabilized, yet semantically open.
