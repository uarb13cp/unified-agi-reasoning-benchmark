Additional Rule:
The requirement of A on B, the influence of B on C, and the constraint of C on A are mutually satisfiable – that is, there exists a state of the system in which all three relationships hold simultaneously.

Explanation:

1. Why this rule is the minimal stabilizing rule:
      The given statements are independent and underspecified; they form a cycle but lack any guarantee that they can coexist without contradiction. The minimal condition for structural coherence is that the three relations are jointly realizable. This rule does not prescribe mechanisms, directions, or semantics – it merely asserts that the system can be in a state where all three are true. It is the weakest possible addition that turns a set of separate claims into a consistent whole.
2. Why no other rule is required:
      Once mutual satisfiability is ensured, the cycle is no longer potentially paradoxical or vacuous. The system now has a consistent interpretation: the components can simultaneously exhibit the three relationships. All ambiguity about the nature of “requires,” “influences,” and “constrains” remains, and no symmetry, feedback, or domain‑specific details are imposed. Further rules would over‑specify the system or introduce unnecessary structure.
3. How the system becomes coherent:
      Coherence here means that the three statements are not just a list but describe a single integrated system. With the added rule, we know that the relationships can be true together, so the triangle of dependencies is logically consistent. The system now has a possible realization, making it a unified whole rather than a set of unrelated or potentially conflicting assertions. The openness of each relation is preserved, yet they are bound by the fact that they can all hold at once.
