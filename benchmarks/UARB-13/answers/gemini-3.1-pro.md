The Stabilizing Rule
The requirement A places on B, the influence B exerts on C, and the constraint C imposes on A must be mutually satisfiable within a continuous context of relevance.
1. Why this rule is the minimal stabilizing rule
To form a unified system, disparate relationships—requiring, influencing, and constraining—must operate in the same dimensional "space," even if that space is abstract. Without this rule, the three statements could exist in isolated contexts: A could require B for electrical power, B could influence C's social behavior, and C could constrain A mathematically.
By enforcing mutual satisfiability within a shared context of relevance, this rule provides the precise logical scaffolding necessary to bind the three components together. It establishes structural compatibility—ensuring the existence of the system is logically possible—without inventing a causal mechanism to explain how it works.
2. Why no other rule is required
This rule alone is sufficient to close the conceptual loop. Any additional rule would inevitably cross the line from establishing systemic coherence into over-specifying the system's nature. For instance:
 * Adding a temporal rule would impose a sequential topology.
 * Adding a balancing rule would impose a feedback or homeostatic mechanism.
 * Adding a proportional rule would impose quantitative or symmetrical semantics.
Once mutual satisfiability is established, the components are intrinsically linked as a single system. No further additions can be made without violating the constraint against injecting domain-specific semantics or operational mechanics.
3. How the system becomes coherent while preserving ambiguity
 * Establishing Coherence: The system transitions from a disconnected set of independent assertions into a logically sound framework. It guarantees that the constraint C places on A does not fundamentally negate A's ability to require B, nor does it contradict B's capacity to influence C. The relationships are guaranteed to be compatible, allowing the system to exist as a unified, non-contradictory whole.
 * Preserving Ambiguity: The system remains a completely blank slate operationally. We still do not know if the system represents biological organisms, economic variables, or abstract algorithms. We do not know the magnitude, duration, or causal nature of the interactions. The rule only ensures that whatever the undefined variables are, they share a reality where their respective conditions can exist simultaneously.
