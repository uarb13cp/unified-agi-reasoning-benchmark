**Additional rule (the one and only stabilizing rule to add):**  
A’s requirement of B, B’s influence on C, and C’s constraint on A are mutually satisfiable.

**1. Why this rule is the minimal stabilizing rule**  
It supplies the single missing structural link at the exact level the prompt permits—joint satisfiability—without touching mechanism, directionality, topology, causality, symmetry, or semantics. The three given statements already describe a complete set of cross-references among the three components; what they lack is any assurance that those cross-references can coexist inside one system. Asserting mutual satisfiability is the smallest possible assertion that closes that gap: it says “these three descriptions are allowed to be true together” and nothing more. Anything weaker would leave open the possibility of outright incompatibility (the constraint could block the requirement even though the influence exists); anything stronger would violate the “no over-specification, no mechanisms, no resolved ambiguity” constraints.

**2. Why no other rule is required**  
Once mutual satisfiability is stated, every permitted form of structural coherence (shared relevance, structural compatibility, mutual inclusion, relevance continuity, joint/conditional relevance) is automatically satisfied at the minimal level. No further rule can be added without either (a) restating the same compatibility in different words, (b) introducing a forbidden element (e.g., “therefore A influences B,” “the influence is feedback,” “they operate in domain X”), or (c) resolving any of the deliberate ambiguities in what “requires,” “influences,” or “constrains” actually mean. The system is now exactly as under-specified as the prompt demands—coherent yet still almost entirely open.

**3. How the system becomes coherent once this rule is added (while preserving all remaining ambiguity)**  
With the four statements now present—A requires B; B influences C; C constrains A; and the three relations are mutually satisfiable—the description forms a single, closed, non-contradictory referent: “the system whose three components stand in exactly these three partially described relationships, and those relationships can hold simultaneously.” The cycle of references is complete, the components are no longer three isolated claims but aspects of one unified (if radically underspecified) whole, and every original vagueness survives untouched: we still do not know the sense in which A requires B, the type of influence B exerts on C, the nature of C’s constraint on A, or any concrete process that realizes any of them. Structural coherence is achieved; nothing else is.  

That is the precise minimal completion that turns the almost-coherent system into the fully (yet still almost entirely ambiguous) coherent one demanded by UARB-13.
