Here is the minimal stabilizing rule:

The influence of B on C must be relevant to the requirement of A for B.

1. Why this is the minimal stabilizing rule

The system as given consists of three independent statements: A requires B, B influences C, and C constrains A. While they form a circular structure (A→B→C→A), there is no guarantee that the dependencies are related. The system lacks relevance continuity.

This rule is minimal because it forges a single, essential link between the system's two "outward-facing" relationships (A requires B and B influences C) without defining the mechanism.

  A requires B: A needs something from B.
  B influences C: B does something to C.

For the system to be coherent, the "something" B provides to A must be related to the "something" B does to C. My proposed rule establishes this connection. It forces the requirement and the influence to share a common basis of relevance, ensuring that the chain of dependency is not arbitrary. It connects the "input" to B (A's requirement) with the "output" from B (B's influence on C).

2. Why no other rule is required

Once this single rule is in place, the rest of the system's coherence follows logically. We do not need to specify the other links in the chain because they become implicitly coherent.

Consider the flow of dependency with the new rule added:

A requires B.
B influences C in a way that is relevant to what A requires from B.
C constrains A.

Because B's influence on C is now tied to A's initial requirement, the resulting state of C is also, by extension, relevant to that requirement. Consequently, when C constrains A, that constraint is no longer arbitrary; it is now necessarily related back to A's original requirement for B. The loop of relevance is closed. Adding another rule, such as explicitly linking C's constraint back to A's requirement, would be redundant.

3. How the system becomes coherent

The rule makes the system coherent by establishing a principle of transitive relevance while preserving all ambiguity about the specific mechanisms.

  Before the rule: The system is just a list of three facts. A could require B for its power supply, B could influence C's color, and C could constrain A's physical size. These relationships are unrelated, and the "system" is just a coincidence.
  After the rule: The system becomes a unified whole. If A requires a specific signal from B, then the rule dictates that B's influence on C must be related to that signal. This influence shapes C, and C's resulting constraint on A is therefore also related to that original signal.

The system is now coherent because the constraint that C imposes on A is guaranteed to be relevant to the very requirement that started the cycle. The nature of each relationship remains undefined—the sense of A's requirement, the type of B's influence, and the nature of C's constraint are still ambiguous—but they are now bound together by a shared, continuous thread of relevance.
