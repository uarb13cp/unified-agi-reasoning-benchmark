One minimal stabilizing rule that could be added is:

"A’s requirement of B is compatible with C’s constraint on A, given B’s influence on C."

### Explanation:

1. **Why this rule is the minimal stabilizing rule**:
   - This rule ensures that the relationships between A, B, and C can coexist without contradiction. It doesn't specify the mechanisms by which A requires B, B influences C, or C constrains A. It only adds the necessary condition that these relationships can coexist without contradiction.

2. **Why no other rule is required**:
   - This rule ensures that the system can function as a unified whole without needing to define the exact nature of the relationships. It preserves the ambiguity about the exact nature of the relationships while ensuring that they can coexist.

3. **How the system becomes coherent once this rule is added**:
   - The system is coherent because there is a state where all the relationships can be satisfied simultaneously. This means that the system can function as a unified whole without contradictions.

Thus, the system becomes coherent as it ensures that the relationships among A, B, and C are mutually compatible without over-specifying the relationships or resolving all ambiguity.
