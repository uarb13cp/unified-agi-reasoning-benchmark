**Proposed minimal stabilizing rule**

> **Stabilizing rule:** The way B influences C is *exactly such* that any resulting state of C is jointly satisfiable with C’s constraint on A whenever A’s requirement on B is satisfied.

In other words: whenever A “successfully” has what it requires from B, the influence B has on C cannot push C into a state that would make C’s constraint on A unsatisfiable; all three relationships must be jointly satisfiable in those cases.[1][2]

***

## 1. Why this is the minimal stabilizing rule

- It does not specify *how* A requires B, *how* B influences C, or *how* C constrains A; it only demands that these three relations admit at least some **jointly compatible configuration**.[1][2]
- It operates purely at the level of **joint satisfiability / coherence**: if A’s requirement on B is met, then B’s influence on C and C’s constraint on A must be structurally compatible, not mutually undermining.[2]
- It does not impose symmetry, feedback, or a particular topology; it only forbids combinations of A–B, B–C, and C–A that would make the system degenerate (e.g., “A can never have B in any way that survives C”).[3]

Without *some* closure-like requirement that “admissible roles are realized only in mutually compatible configurations,” the three clauses can be pairwise meaningful but globally incoherent.[4][3] This rule is the *weakest* such closure: it only applies when A’s requirement on B is met and says no more than “there is a way for all three relations to hold together.”

***

## 2. Why no other rule is required

- Once you require that A’s requirement on B, B’s influence on C, and C’s constraint on A be **jointly satisfiable in at least some cases**, you already have a unified structure rather than three unrelated or potentially contradictory constraints.[4][2]
- Additional rules (e.g., making the relations symmetric, specifying temporal order, causal mechanism, or logical form) would move from **minimal coherence** to a specific *model* of the system, violating the “no mechanism / no over‑specification” requirement.[5][6]
- The stabilizing rule covers structural coherence both locally and globally: locally, each relation can be arbitrary; globally, the triple is constrained only not to collapse into mutual exclusion when A’s requirement is satisfied.[2][3] Nothing more is needed for the system to qualify as a single, coherent whole.

## 3. How the system becomes coherent with this rule

With the rule added, the three relations now form a **single admissible configuration space**:

- A can stand in *some* requiring relation to B.  
- Given that requirement is met, B’s influence on C is allowed to vary, but only within the subset of C‑states that remain compatible with C’s constraint on A.  
- C’s constraint on A, in turn, no longer threatens to annihilate any successful satisfaction of A’s requirement on B; it operates within a space already filtered for joint compatibility.[4][2]

All mechanistic details remain open: “require,” “influence,” and “constrain” are not given logical, causal, or semantic specifics; only their **mutual relevance and joint satisfiability** are fixed. The system thus becomes a coherent triad—one structured whole—while preserving maximal ambiguity about the internal nature of each link.
