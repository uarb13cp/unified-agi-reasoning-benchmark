## The Stabilizing Rule

**A's requirement, B's influence, and C's constraint must maintain joint satisfiability.**

***

## Explanation

### 1. Why this rule is the minimal stabilizing rule
This rule is minimal because it imposes a **logical boundary condition** rather than adding a new component, directional link, or operational mechanism. The existing system already possesses a topological structure (a cycle of dependencies: A→B→C→A). The only threat to the coherence of this structure, given the undefined nature of the relationships, is logical contradiction (e.g., C constrains A in a way that makes A's requirement for B impossible). By asserting **joint satisfiability**, we guarantee that a valid state exists where all three relationships hold true simultaneously, without dictating *what* that state is. It adds the least possible information required to prevent system collapse.

### 2. Why no other rule is required
No other rule is required because the only remaining point of failure in an undefined cyclic dependency is **inconsistency**. 
*   Adding a rule about *mechanism* would violate the constraint against specifying causal processes. 
*   Adding a rule about *symmetry* or *feedback* would violate the constraint against imposing specific topologies. 
*   Adding a rule to define the *nature* of the relationships would violate the constraint against resolving ambiguity. 
Once joint satisfiability is established, the system is logically stable; it is possible for the system to exist. Any further rules would be redundant or would over-specify the system beyond the "minimal" threshold.

### 3. How the system becomes coherent once this rule is added
The system becomes coherent by transitioning from three isolated conditional statements into a **single valid possibility space**. 
*   **Before the rule:** A, B, and C could theoretically contradict one another (e.g., A needs B, but C forbids B), rendering the system impossible.
*   **After the rule:** The relationships are bound by the condition that they *can* coexist. This creates structural coherence through **compatibility** rather than mechanism. 
*   **Preservation of Ambiguity:** The rule does not define *how* the satisfiability is achieved, nor does it clarify *in what sense* A requires B or *what type* of influence B exerts. It merely asserts that whatever those undefined natures turn out to be, they must not negate one another. The ambiguity of the "sense," "type," and "nature" remains intact, but the ambiguity is now contained within a logically consistent framework.
