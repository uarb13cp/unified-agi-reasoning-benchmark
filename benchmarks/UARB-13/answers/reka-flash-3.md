**Additional Rule:**  
*A’s requirement on B is mutually satisfiable with B’s influence on C, and B’s influence on C is mutually satisfiable with C’s constraint on A.*

### **1. Why This Rule is the Minimal Stabilizing Rule**  
This rule directly connects the three ambiguous relationships into a coherent cycle without inventing mechanisms or resolving ambiguity. It introduces **mutual satisfiability**—a logical dependency where each component’s role is fulfilled by the next component’s action. By linking A’s requirement to B’s influence and B’s influence to C’s constraint, it ensures the system forms a closed loop:  
- A requires B → B influences C → C constrains A → A’s requirement is re-satisfied.  
This creates a self-reinforcing structure where no component can fulfill its role independently, enforcing interdependence. The rule is minimal because it adds no new relationships or semantics, only clarifies how existing ones interlock.

### **2. Why No Other Rule is Required**  
The system already contains three dependencies (A→B, B→C, C→A), forming a cyclical topology. The missing link was not another dependency but a **meta-relationship** binding them into a unified whole. Mutual satisfiability resolves structural incoherence by ensuring the cycle is logically consistent: each requirement is purposefully tied to an influence, and each influence is purposefully tied to a constraint. No further rules are needed because:  
- The cycle is now self-sustaining (no loose ends).  
- Ambiguity about *how* relationships work (e.g., "sense of requirement") is preserved, as the rule only specifies *logical compatibility*, not causal mechanics.  
- Symmetry or feedback is not imposed; the cycle remains asymmetric but coherent.

### **3. How the System Becomes Coherent**  
Before the rule, the system was three disconnected statements: A requires B, B influences C, C constrains A. The added rule ties them into a **logical feedback loop**:  
- **A’s requirement on B** is only meaningful if B’s influence on C occurs (e.g., B’s action satisfies A’s need).  
- **B’s influence on C** is only meaningful if C’s constraint on A occurs (e.g., C’s limitation ensures B’s influence aligns with A’s goals).  
- **C’s constraint on A** is only meaningful if A’s requirement on B occurs (e.g., A’s dependency triggers C’s constraint).  

This creates **structural compatibility**: the system’s components are no longer isolated roles but interdependent functions in a shared cycle. For example:  
- If A requires B to perform X, B’s influence on C must involve X (mutual satisfiability).  
- C’s constraint on A must then relate to X (e.g., limiting A to ensure B’s X is effective).  

The system remains ambiguous about *how* these relationships materialize (e.g., causal direction, granularity of "X"), but their **coherence** emerges from the logical interlocking of requirements, influences, and constraints. The cycle ensures the system cannot function as three unrelated statements—it must operate as a unified whole.
