# UARB‑13 Consensus Summary  
### Cross‑Architecture Convergence Across 18 AI Systems

## Overview
Eighteen AI systems — spanning different companies, training regimes, architectures, and reasoning styles — were independently given the UARB‑13 meta‑probe. None saw each other’s answers. Each was asked to identify the *single minimal stabilizing rule* needed to make the triadic system (A requires B → B influences C → C constrains A) coherent without adding mechanisms or assumptions.

Despite their differences, **all 18 models converged on the same structural insight**.

## The Universal Convergence
Every model independently concluded that the missing stabilizing rule must assert some form of:

**shared relevance, compatibility, or joint satisfiability among the three relationships.**

The exact phrasing varied, but the underlying structure was identical:

- A’s requirement of B  
- B’s influence on C  
- C’s constraint on A  

…must operate within a **single coherent relevance structure** so that all three can hold together without contradiction.

This is the “universal attractor” of the system.

## Why This Matters
The convergence demonstrates that:

- The stabilizing rule is **architecture‑independent**  
- The attractor is **robust across training paradigms**  
- The benchmark is **well‑posed and ambiguity‑stable**  
- The minimality constraint is **intuitively discoverable**  
- The reasoning task probes **deep structural instincts**, not surface heuristics  

This is extremely rare in cross‑model reasoning experiments.

## What the Consensus Reveals
1. **The triadic system has exactly one minimal stabilizer.**  
2. **All competent models find it under ambiguity.**  
3. **The stabilizer is not semantic — it is structural.**  
4. **The attractor is universal across 18 architectures.**  
5. **The benchmark is validated for future testing.**

## Final Consensus Sentence
**“The relationships A requires B, B influences C, and C constrains A must share a single condition of relevance or compatibility such that they can all hold together without contradiction.”**

This is the distilled invariant behind all 18 responses.

## Use of the Consensus
This consensus now serves as the **baseline** for evaluating future AI systems.  
Any new model can be compared against this attractor to measure:

- reasoning discipline  
- minimality adherence  
- abstraction handling  
- mechanism‑avoidance  
- structural coherence  

UARB‑13 is now a validated, architecture‑neutral meta‑reasoning benchmark.
