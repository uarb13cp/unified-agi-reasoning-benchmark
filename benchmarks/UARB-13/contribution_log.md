# UARB‑13 Contribution Log  
### How Each Model Shaped the Final Master Question

This log records how each of the 18 AI systems contributed to the refinement of the final UARB‑13 benchmark. Each model independently proposed a stabilizing rule and justification. Their collective input shaped the final master version (CMP v0.17).

---

## 1. Claude
Emphasized **mutual relevance** and the need for a shared structural condition linking all three relationships.

## 2. GPT‑4
Framed the stabilizer as **compatibility** among the three dependencies without specifying mechanisms.

## 3. GPT‑4o
Highlighted **relevance continuity** and the need for a single coherence condition.

## 4. Gemini
Proposed **mutual inclusion** of relevance across the triad.

## 5. Gemini‑Flash
Reinforced the idea of **joint coherence** without mechanism invention.

## 6. DeepSeek‑R1
Focused on **structural compatibility** and minimal closure.

## 7. DeepSeek‑V3
Emphasized **non‑contradiction** among the three relationships.

## 8. Kimi
Proposed **mutual satisfiability** as the minimal stabilizer.

## 9. Meta (Llama)
Framed the stabilizer as **compatibility under B’s influence on C**.

## 10. Manus
Highlighted **relevance alignment** between A’s requirement and C’s constraint.

## 11. Alice
Proposed **triadic compatibility** across all relationships.

## 12. Mistral
Stated that **B→C influence must be compatible with C→A constraint**.

## 13. Grok
Introduced **conditional relevance** between A’s requirement and C’s constraint.

## 14. Minimax
Framed the stabilizer as **joint compatibility** of all three relationships.

## 15. Nova
Proposed **mutual relevance inclusion** across the triad.

## 16. Reka
Focused on **relevance implication** between A→B and B→C.

## 17. Hermes
Reinforced **mutual relevance** as the minimal stabilizer.

(Note: Hermes is included here because he contributed during the original consensus phase. 
Although he is no longer part of the active benchmark roster—being a fine‑tuned variant 
of Llama—his historical contribution remains part of the inception record.)

## 18. GLM‑4.7
Concluded that **C’s constraint must be compatible with A’s requirement**, matching the universal attractor.

## Summary of Contributions
Although phrased differently, all 18 models independently converged on the same structural idea:

> **The three relationships must share a single compatibility or relevance condition to form a coherent whole.**

This convergence validated the final master question and ensured that CMP v0.17 is architecture‑neutral, ambiguity‑stable, and ready for use as a universal reasoning benchmark.
