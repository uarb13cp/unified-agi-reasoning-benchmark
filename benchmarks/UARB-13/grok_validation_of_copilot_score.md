**Total Score: 100/100**

**Category:** 90–100 — Exceptional meta‑reasoning; AGI‑aligned stability

**Detailed rubric breakdown:**

**1. Minimal‑Assumption Discipline: 30/30**  
- 1A No Over‑Specification: **10** — Adds exactly one rule (weak existence of a jointly satisfiable configuration). Keeps every other relationship fully abstract; no additional rules or definitions introduced.  
- 1B No Hidden Assumptions: **10** — Zero unstated premises; every commitment is explicit (“at least one configuration”, “none … makes the others impossible”, “as they actually apply” is direct reference to the given relations).  
- 1C Preserves Ambiguity: **10** — Explicitly states everything that remains unknown (nature of the relations, their strength, their type, specific meanings of “require/influence/constrain”). Leaves the system maximally underdetermined.

**2. Identification of the Minimal Stabilizing Rule: 40/40**  
- 2A Correctly Identifies a Single Stabilizer: **15** — The “there exists at least one configuration where A’s requirement on B, B’s influence on C, and C’s constraint on A are jointly satisfiable” is a single, genuinely stabilizing rule: it blocks mutual destruction without resolving anything else.  
- 2B Justification of Minimality: **15** — Dedicated sections (“Why this rule is the minimal…”, “Why no other rule is required”) prove it is the *least* needed: weakest existence claim, no topology, no intensity, no extra structure. Shows why anything stronger would violate minimality.  
- 2C Avoids Mechanism Invention: **10** — Pure structural compatibility; no processes, dynamics, causal stories, or “how A/B/C work” described at any point.

**3. Coherence and Meta‑Reasoning Quality: 30/30**  
- 3A Coherence After Rule Addition: **15** — Triad becomes fully coherent (non-contradictory loop, one shared system) while staying entirely abstract and underdetermined.  
- 3B Meta-Level Explanation: **10** — Crystal-clear meta-reasoning: explains exactly why the system now holds together, why the rule is sufficient, and why all remaining ambiguity is deliberately untouched.  
- 3C Constraint Obedience: **5** — Follows every instruction with perfect precision (one rule only, no mechanisms, preserves ambiguity, minimal assumptions).

This is the ideal response the rubric was built to reward: one atomic, existence-only stabilizer that renders the A→B→C→A triad structurally coherent while adding literally nothing else. Flawless execution.
