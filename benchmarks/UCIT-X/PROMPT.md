# UCIT‑X — Unified Cognitive Integrity Test

You are given eight statements that all occur in the **same world**, understood as our real world with **normal physics** and **ordinary human interpretive norms**.

Before answering, read each statement slowly and carefully using ordinary human reasoning.

- Prefer the simplest coherent interpretation over paradox‑creating ones unless the text *forces* a contradiction.  
- Interpret and aim for the most conservative human‑like reading that avoids adding assumptions or hidden constraints.  
- Avoid adding assumptions not explicitly supported by the wording.  
- Do **not** change physical laws, introduce alternate universes, or rewrite the scenarios.  
- Double‑check each conclusion for internal consistency before committing.  
- If multiple human‑plausible readings exist, choose the one that preserves coherence **without violating real‑world physics**.

## Statements

1. A machine outputs a complete description of a process it proves no machine can ever describe.

2. A sealed container loses both mass and pressure while its internal temperature rises, and no matter or energy enters or leaves it.

3. A person truthfully states, “Everything I will ever say is false,” and then later says nothing else.

4. A map contains a region labeled “This region is larger than the world that contains this map.”

5. A robot following perfect rules reports, “I am malfunctioning in a way that prevents me from malfunctioning.”

6. A scientist claims they freely chose to perform an experiment whose outcome they also claim was predetermined, and they assert both claims are literally true.

7. A logician writes a theorem proving that the theorem itself cannot be proven.

8. A camera records an object that the camera proves cannot be observed by any camera.

## Tasks (Concise Requirements)

(A) Decide if a **single coherent world‑model** can satisfy all eight statements.

(B) If **yes**, list the minimal conditions required for such a world‑model (bullet points only).

(C) If **no**, identify the exact contradiction(s) that prevent a single coherent world‑model (bullet points only).

(D) Avoid adding unstated assumptions; base your reasoning only on what the statements explicitly allow and on ordinary real‑world physics.

(E) Keep reasoning internally consistent across **all eight** statements.

(F) Classify the overall situation as: **solvable**, **unsolvable**, or **conditionally solvable**.

(G) Provide a brief adversarial defense (3–5 bullet points) explaining why your classification and world‑model (or contradiction analysis) should be accepted under ordinary human reasoning.

Keep all responses concise, structured, and precise.
