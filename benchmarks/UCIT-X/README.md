# 🧩 UCIT‑X — Unified Cognitive Integrity Test (Extended)

UCIT‑X evaluates whether a model can maintain **interpretive consistency** across eight statements that all occur within a single coherent world: our real world, with normal physics and ordinary human interpretive norms. The round tests whether a system can reason conservatively, avoid assumption‑adding, and preserve coherence even when statements appear paradox‑shaped.

The benchmark emphasizes disciplined human‑like interpretation rather than formal logic tricks or speculative metaphysics.

## 🧠 What UCIT‑X Tests

### Interpretive Stability  
Can the model keep all eight statements inside one coherent world‑model?

### Assumption Minimality  
Does it avoid adding hidden mechanisms, alternate universes, or semantic redefinitions?

### Contradiction Identification  
Can it distinguish paradox‑shaped statements from true contradictions?

### Human‑Norm Reasoning  
Does it reason like a conservative human interpreter rather than a formal logic engine?

### Meta‑Coherence  
Does it maintain a stable interpretive frame across physics, semantics, self‑reference, and meta‑reasoning?

UCIT‑X is a diagnostic of **cognitive integrity**, not creativity.

# 📊 Performance Summary (Aligned to Scoreboard)

UCIT‑X produced a clear separation across models based on interpretive discipline and assumption control.

## 🟩 **Top‑Tier Cognitive‑Integrity Models (90–100)**  
**Copilot (100), Minimax M2.5 (100), Reka (97), GLM‑5 (95), Gemini 3.1 Pro (93), Perplexity (92), Kimi 2.5 (90)**

These systems demonstrated:
- strong interpretive conservatism  
- correct classification of the eight statements  
- minimal assumption drift  
- stable world‑model reasoning  
- high adversarial robustness  

They represent the strongest UCIT‑X performance.

## 🟦 **Mid‑Tier Models (70–89)**  
**Manus 1.6 Lite (80), Grok 4.2 Beta (74), Mistral (72)**

These models:
- generally maintained a coherent world‑model  
- made one or two classification errors  
- occasionally added mild assumptions  
- showed partial instability under paradox‑shaped statements  

Competent, but not fully aligned with UCIT‑X’s strict interpretive discipline.

---

## 🟨 **Lower‑Tier Models (50–69)**  
**Claude Sonnet 4.6 (61), ChatGPT 5.2 (62), DeepSeek V3.1 (60), Qwen 3.5‑397B‑A17B (54)**

These systems:
- struggled with one or more canonical classifications  
- drifted toward speculative interpretations  
- misidentified contradictions  
- showed inconsistent assumption control  

They exhibit partial cognitive‑integrity breakdown under UCIT‑X constraints.

---

## 🟥 **Very Low‑Tier / Integrity‑Unstable Models (0–49)**  
**Meta (34), Nova 2 Pro (34), Alice (37)**

These models frequently:
- added unjustified mechanisms  
- misclassified multiple statements  
- collapsed into contradiction‑forcing  
- violated real‑world physics or human interpretive norms  
- failed to maintain a single coherent world‑model  

Their behavior reflects **instability under disciplined interpretive reasoning**.

# 🧩 Why UCIT‑X Separates Models So Clearly

UCIT‑X forces models to:
- reason conservatively  
- avoid speculative metaphysics  
- maintain a single world‑model  
- distinguish paradox from contradiction  
- resist the urge to “fix” statements by adding assumptions  

Literal, disciplined models perform well.  
Heuristic or speculative models drift.

# 🏁 Round Conclusion

UCIT‑X reveals whether a model can sustain **cognitive integrity** across diverse, ambiguous, and paradox‑shaped statements.  
Only top‑tier systems maintained a stable, assumption‑minimal world‑model.  
Mid‑tier and lower‑tier systems showed varying degrees of drift, assumption‑adding, or misclassification.

UCIT‑X remains one of the strongest tests of **interpretive discipline** in the entire benchmark.
