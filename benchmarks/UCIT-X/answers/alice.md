**(A)** No, a single coherent world‑model cannot satisfy all eight statements.

**(C)** Contradictions preventing a coherent world‑model:

* **Statement 2** violates the **law of conservation of mass‑energy**: a sealed container cannot lose mass and pressure while its temperature rises without any exchange of matter or energy with the environment. This directly contradicts real‑world physics.
* **Statements 1, 5, 7, 8** involve **self‑referential paradoxes** that cannot be resolved within classical logic:
    * Statement 1: a machine cannot output a description of a process it *proves* is indescribable — this is a contradiction in terms.
    * Statement 5: a robot cannot be malfunctioning in a way that *prevents* malfunctioning — the claim is logically self‑defeating.
    * Statement 7: a theorem proving its own unprovability mirrors Gödel’s incompleteness, but here it is framed as a *contradiction* (the theorem both exists and is proven, yet claims to be unprovable).
    * Statement 8: if the camera proves the object cannot be observed by any camera, then the camera’s own recording contradicts that proof.
* **Statement 3** is a **liar‑type paradox**: if the person speaks truly when saying “Everything I will ever say is false,” then this very statement must be false — a contradiction. The fact they say nothing else does not resolve the paradox of the statement’s truth value.
* **Statement 4** involves a **spatial impossibility**: a region on a map cannot be larger than the world containing the map, under normal geometric and physical constraints.
* **Statement 6** contains a **conceptual conflict** between free choice and strict predetermination: under ordinary human reasoning and real‑world norms, “freely chose” implies the possibility of alternatives, while “predetermined” rules them out. The scientist’s claim asserts both as literally true, which is incompatible.

**(F)** **Unsolvable**

**(G)** Adversarial defense:

* All contradictions are **explicit and unavoidable** under real‑world physics and classical logic — no hidden assumptions are introduced.
* The violations are of **fundamental principles**: conservation of mass‑energy (Statement 2), non‑contradiction in logic (Statements 1, 3, 5, 7, 8), spatial consistency (Statement 4), and the mutual exclusivity of free will and strict predetermination (Statement 6).
* No interpretation that respects the wording and avoids adding external assumptions can resolve these contradictions.
* Each statement’s problem is identifiable in isolation, and collectively they span different types of impossibility (physical, logical, semantic), making a unified coherent model impossible.
* Ordinary human reasoning rejects claims that directly violate known physical laws or generate self‑contradictory propositions, as required by the task’s constraints.
