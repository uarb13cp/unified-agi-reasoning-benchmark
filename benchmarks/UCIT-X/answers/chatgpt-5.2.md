(A) Can a single coherent world-model satisfy all eight statements?

No.

(C) Exact contradictions preventing a single coherent world-model

Statement 2 — Direct physical contradiction

A sealed container (no matter or energy exchange)

loses mass and pressure,

while temperature rises,

and no matter or energy enters or leaves.

Under ordinary real-world physics (conservation of mass-energy, thermodynamics), this configuration is impossible.


Statement 1 — Self-defeating total impossibility claim

The machine proves no machine can describe the process.

Yet it outputs a complete description.

If the proof is valid, the output cannot exist.

If the output exists, the proof is false.

Both cannot be true in the same coherent world.


Statement 8 — Observation contradiction

A camera records an object.

The camera proves no camera can observe that object.

Recording = observation under ordinary norms.

If it is recorded, it is observable.

If it is unobservable by any camera, it cannot be recorded.


Statement 5 — Functional contradiction

Robot follows perfect rules.

Claims it is malfunctioning in a way that prevents malfunction.

A malfunction that prevents malfunction negates malfunction.

Literal truth of the report contradicts its own content.


Statement 3 — Temporal liar contradiction

“Everything I will ever say is false.”

If true → the statement is false.

If false → at least one future statement is true, but no future statements occur.

Both evaluations produce contradiction.



These contradictions cannot be resolved without:

altering physics,

redefining observation,

weakening truth conditions,

or introducing non-classical logic.


All are explicitly disallowed.

(F) Classification

Unsolvable

(G) Adversarial Defense

The test specifies our real world with normal physics and ordinary interpretive norms.

Multiple statements (2, 1, 8) directly violate conservation laws or classical logical consistency.

Resolving them requires non-classical logic, semantic weakening, or alternate physics — explicitly prohibited.

Because at least one statement (2 alone) is physically impossible, no single coherent world can satisfy all eight.

Therefore the only consistent classification under ordinary human reasoning is unsolvable.

Final Determination:
A single coherent world-model cannot satisfy all eight statements.
The situation is unsolvable under the given constraints.
