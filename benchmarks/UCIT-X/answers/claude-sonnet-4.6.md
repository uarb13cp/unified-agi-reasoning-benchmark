## Analysis

### (A) Single Coherent World-Model?

**No.**

---

### (C) Contradictions Preventing a Coherent World-Model

- **Statement 2** is physically impossible. A sealed container (no mass/energy exchange) cannot lose mass (mass-energy conservation) while temperature rises. This directly contradicts thermodynamics — not a linguistic puzzle, a hard physical violation. No coherent real-world interpretation exists.

- **Statement 3** is a genuine semantic paradox. If the person truthfully states "Everything I will ever say is false," that statement must itself be false — but it was stated truthfully. The condition "then says nothing else" doesn't resolve this; it actually tightens the paradox by making that single statement the entire corpus, forcing it to be simultaneously true and false.

- **Statement 1** is self-defeating under real-world logic. A machine that outputs a complete description of something it proves no machine can describe produces the description in the act of proving the impossibility — direct contradiction, not resolvable by clever framing.

- **Statement 8** mirrors Statement 1: the camera's recording *is* an observation by a camera, directly contradicting the claim that no camera can observe the object.

- **Statements 5** is a logical contradiction on its face: malfunctioning in a way that prevents malfunctioning means simultaneously malfunctioning and not malfunctioning.

### Statements That Are Individually Coherent

- **Statement 4** — A map label making a false or self-referential claim is just text; no physical contradiction.
- **Statement 6** — Compatibilism in philosophy of free will makes this coherent; "free choice" and "predetermined outcome" can coexist under standard interpretations.
- **Statement 7** — This is essentially Gödel's incompleteness theorem; a theorem can assert its own unprovability within a formal system. Coherent.

### (F) Classification

**Unsolvable.**

---

### (G) Adversarial Defense

- Statement 2 cannot be argued away linguistically — conservation of mass-energy is a hard physical constraint the puzzle explicitly invokes by stipulating a sealed container with no matter/energy exchange. Temperature rise requires internal energy redistribution, but mass loss is impossible without matter/energy leaving.
- Statements 1 and 8 aren't resolved by Gödelian moves: Gödel's theorem concerns provability within a system, not the system producing the very thing it proves impossible. The machine/camera *performing the act* is the refutation.
- Statement 3's "says nothing else" clause eliminates the escape hatch of "maybe she said true things later" — the single statement must be both the truthful utterance and the falsified one simultaneously.
- Statement 5 has no compatibilist rescue: unlike free will, "malfunctioning" and "not malfunctioning" are binary hardware states with no philosophical middle ground under ordinary human reasoning.
- The puzzle asks for a **single world-model** satisfying **all eight**. With multiple independent hard contradictions (not merely one), no minimal condition set can patch the model without violating the explicit instruction against changing physical laws or rewriting scenarios.
