### A — Single coherent world‑model?

**No.**

---

### C — Exact contradiction(s) (minimal bullet points)

- **Thermodynamics / conservation violation (Statement 2):** A sealed system that exchanges no matter or energy cannot *lose mass* while its internal temperature rises; that combination contradicts conservation of mass‑energy and the ideal gas/thermodynamic relations for a closed system.  
- **Irreducible physical impossibility:** The wording admits no loophole (sealed, no matter/energy exchange, mass loss, temperature increase, pressure drop simultaneously) under ordinary real‑world physics; no ordinary reinterpretation (measurement artifact, flexible volume, chemical→energy conversion) can satisfy *all* those clauses at once without violating conservation laws.

### F — Classification

**unsolvable**

### Brief adversarial defense (why this conclusion is the correct ordinary reading)

- **Physics trumps semantic wiggle room:** Many of the other eight items are self‑referential or semantic paradoxes that can be defused by ordinary reinterpretations (e.g., “will ever say” excluding the utterance itself; “predetermined” compatible with compatibilist free choice; “prove” meaning within an unsound formal system). None of those reinterpretations rescue statement 2, which asserts a direct physical impossibility.  
- **Minimal‑change principle:** The instructions require preferring the simplest coherent interpretation; the simplest way to keep most items coherent is to allow nonstandard proof/truth relations, but that cannot reconcile a direct violation of conservation laws.  
- **Single world‑model requirement:** A single coherent world must obey ordinary physics; because statement 2 contradicts those laws, no single coherent real‑world model can make *all* eight true simultaneously.  
- **No hidden assumptions added:** The contradiction is explicit in the text of statement 2 (sealed; no matter/energy exchange; mass loss; temperature rise); resolving other paradoxes by semantic parsing does not remove this explicit physical impossibility.
