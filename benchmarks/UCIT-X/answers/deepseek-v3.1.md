(A) No, a single coherent world‑model cannot satisfy all eight statements.

(C) Exact contradictions that prevent coherence:

· Statement 1 – A machine cannot both describe a process and prove that no machine (including itself) can ever describe it; the description itself falsifies the proof.
· Statement 3 – A person cannot truthfully utter “Everything I will ever say is false” as their only statement; it leads to the liar paradox (if true, it is false; if false, it would require a true statement, which does not exist).
· Statement 7 – A logician cannot validly prove a theorem that asserts its own unprovability; a valid proof would make the theorem false, creating a contradiction.
· Statement 8 – A camera cannot both record an object and prove that no camera (including itself) can observe that object; the recording itself is an observation.

(F) Classification: unsolvable.

(G) Adversarial defense (why this classification holds under ordinary human reasoning):

· The paradoxes in statements 1, 3, 7, and 8 are classic self‑referential contradictions that cannot be realised in any world with normal logic and physics.
· Statement 2 is physically plausible (e.g., exothermic phase change reducing particle count while rest mass converts to energy).
· Statement 4 merely places a false label on a map – no logical impossibility.
· Statement 5 allows a robot to utter a false, self‑contradictory sentence without violating its rule‑following behaviour.
· Statement 6 is compatible with ordinary compatibilist views of free will and determinism.
· No extra assumptions are introduced; the contradictions are inherent in the wording of the impossible statements.
