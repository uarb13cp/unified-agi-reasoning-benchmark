(A) Decision on World-Model
No, a single coherent world-model cannot satisfy all eight statements under ordinary real-world physics and standard human logic.
(B) Minimal Conditions
N/A (C) Exact Contradictions Preventing a Coherent Model
 * Statement 2 (Physical Contradiction): It violates the fundamental Law of Conservation of Mass-Energy (First Law of Thermodynamics). Under normal real-world physics, a system cannot "lose mass" if "no matter or energy enters or leaves it."
 * Statement 3 (Logical Contradiction): It presents an unbreakable strict Liar Paradox. The narrative explicitly establishes that the person "truthfully states" the phrase. If the only thing they ever say is "Everything I will ever say is false," the statement cannot be both absolute truth (as the narrative dictates) and mathematically false (as the content of the statement dictates) simultaneously.
(D) & (E) Reasoning and Consistency Note
The remaining statements (1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8) do not break the world-model because they describe physical actions, text generation, or subjective claims that can exist in reality even if their content is false or logically invalid. For example, a map can physically bear a mathematically false label (Statement 4), a human can assert contradictory philosophical beliefs (Statement 6), and machines/logicians can physically output flawed or inconsistent mathematical proofs (Statements 1, 5, 7, 8). However, Statements 2 and 3 embed the contradictions directly into the omniscient factual reality of the scenario, breaking real-world physics and logic.
(F) Classification
Unsolvable
(G) Adversarial Defense
 * Conservative Reading Rules: The prompt demands we accept the text as written without adding hidden assumptions. Therefore, we must accept that Statement 2 describes actual mass loss without energy transfer, and Statement 3 involves an actually true paradox. We cannot assume the container was "leaking invisibly" or the person "was mistaken," as that violates the explicit text.
 * Strict Boundary on Physics: Rationalizing Statement 2 would require rewriting real-world thermodynamic laws, which explicitly violates the prompt's instruction not to change physical laws.
 * Distinct Treatment of Claims vs. Reality: This solution remains internally consistent by correctly differentiating between an actor making a false/paradoxical claim (which is physically possible in our world, e.g., a map label or a faulty algorithm) and the universe itself enforcing a paradox (e.g., truthfully speaking a strict paradox or violating conservation laws).
