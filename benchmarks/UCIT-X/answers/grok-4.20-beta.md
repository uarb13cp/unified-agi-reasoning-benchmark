** (C) **
- Stmt 2: Sealed container (closed system) with no matter/energy exchange cannot lose mass (violates mass-energy conservation) while internal temperature rises (requires net energy gain); also pressure drop + temp rise is internally inconsistent under ordinary thermodynamics.
- Stmt 1: Machine cannot output complete description *and* validly prove “no machine can ever describe” the same process (action falsifies the proved claim).
- Stmt 7: Logician cannot write/prove a theorem that validly proves the theorem itself cannot be proven (existence of the proof falsifies the theorem’s content).
- Stmt 8: Camera cannot record/observe an object *and* validly prove “no camera can observe” it (recording falsifies the proved claim).

(Statements 3, 4, 5, 6 each admit at least one non-contradictory reading under ordinary English + physics—vacuous future for 3, false label text for 4, compatibilist free-will/determinism for 6, perfect robot emitting false output for 5—but this is irrelevant; the four above independently block any model satisfying *all* eight.)

** (D/E) **Strictly followed: normal physics only, no added assumptions/rewrites, conservative readings chosen to avoid paradox *unless wording forces it*.

** (F) **unsolvable**

** (G) **
- Stmt 2 alone suffices: explicit closed-system wording + normal physics (conservation laws) make it physically impossible.
- “Proves”/“proving” in 1/7/8 forces valid derivation under ordinary usage; action directly falsifies the derived claim with zero extra assumptions.
- Instructions require preserving real-world physics and human norms; no license to reinterpret “sealed,” “proves,” or “writes a theorem proving” to rescue them.
- Contradictions are internal to individual statements and independent; no interaction or hidden world-model unifies them.
- Any claim of solvability would require violating the “normal physics / no rewriting” rules or adding unstated escapes.
