I'll analyze each statement carefully using ordinary human reasoning and real-world physics.

Statement-by-Statement Analysis

1. Machine describing the undescribable
This is a self-reference paradox similar to Gödel's incompleteness. The machine outputs a complete description of X, while proving no machine can describe X. If the machine succeeded in outputting the description, the description exists—contradicting the proof that no such description exists. However, if we interpret this as: the machine outputs a proof that no machine can describe the process, and separately attempts (but fails) to output the description itself, this becomes coherent. The machine outputs a proof of impossibility, not the actual description.

2. Sealed container losing mass/pressure while heating
This violates conservation laws if interpreted naively. However, "no matter or energy enters or leaves" combined with mass loss suggests nuclear decay: mass converts to energy (heat), increasing temperature. But pressure decreasing while temperature rises in a sealed container contradicts ideal gas laws unless... the container has a pressure relief (not sealed to pressure) or undergoes chemical/nuclear reorganization reducing gas moles. Actually, with "sealed" meaning impermeable: if mass converts to energy (E=mc²), the container loses rest mass, and if products bind more tightly (fewer free particles), pressure could drop despite temperature rise. This is physically possible with nuclear transmutation.

3. "Everything I will ever say is false"
If true, then this statement itself is false (since it's something they say). If false, then not everything they say is false (something is true). But they say nothing else afterward. So their only statement is "Everything I will ever say is false"—if true, it's false (paradox). However, if we interpret "will ever say" as future-tense excluding present, and they say nothing later, the statement becomes vacuously true (there are no future false statements to make it false). This is the simplest reading.

4. Map region larger than its world
A map is a representation, not the territory. The label describes a region, but the region itself (as depicted) can be drawn arbitrarily large while occupying tiny physical space. The statement compares the represented region's size to the physical world containing the map. This is coherent: a map can depict a fictional region of any size, and "larger than" refers to the abstract representation, not physical extent.

5. Malfunction preventing malfunction
Self-referential but resolvable: "Malfunctioning" can mean attempting to malfunction but failing due to a protective override. The robot reports it's malfunctioning (attempting to deviate from rules) but a safety mechanism prevents the malfunction from actualizing. The statement is literally true: the malfunction state exists but is prevented from affecting output.

6. Free choice + predetermined outcome
Compatibilist interpretation: "Freely chose" means absence of coercion (internal deliberation unconstrained by external force), while "predetermined" means causal determinism. These are not contradictory—free will as non-coerced action is compatible with determinism. Both claims can be literally true under standard philosophical compatibilism.

7. Theorem proving itself unprovable
Gödelian: If the theorem is proven, it's false (since it claims unprovability). If unproven, it's unproven. This is the standard incompleteness result—the theorem exists but cannot be proven within the system. The logician writes the theorem (states it), but cannot prove it. "Writes a theorem proving" can mean the theorem's content is about unprovability, not that the logician proved it. Coherent.

8. Camera recording unobservable object
Similar to #1: The camera records (captures image of) an object while proving no camera can observe it. If "proves" means outputs a proof regarding theoretical limits, while the recording happened under special circumstances (quantum collapse, brief window before proof applies), or if "observed" means something different from "recorded" (philosophical distinction between measurement and observation), this can be coherent. Or: the camera records it, then proves why the recording shouldn't have been possible, creating a paradoxical but documented event.

Answers

(A) Single coherent world-model?
YES — All eight can coexist in a single world-model with careful, conservative interpretation.

(B) Minimal conditions required:

- Self-reference allowed: Statements can refer to themselves or their containers without immediate paradox (distinguishing object-language from meta-language)
- Compatibilist free will: "Free choice" and "determinism" are compatible (no libertarian free will required)
- Representation ≠ Reality: Maps, theorems, and descriptions are abstract representations distinct from physical objects they represent
- Process/state distinctions: Distinguishing between attempting/being/preventing (malfunction as state vs. effect)
- Conservation laws hold: Mass-energy conversion explains #2; E=mc² permits mass loss → energy gain
- Temporal indexing: "Will ever" in #3 excludes present; "proves" in #1/#8 can apply to future/general cases while specific instances occur

(C) Contradictions preventing model: (Not applicable—answer is YES)

(D) Assumptions check:
All assumptions above are explicitly supported by statement wording or standard real-world physics (E=mc², compatibilism as mainstream position, self-reference in language, representation theory).

(E) Internal consistency:
- #1 & #8: Machines/cameras output proofs about general impossibility while specific instances occur (no contradiction)
- #2: Nuclear decay fits all constraints
- #3: Vacuous truth with temporal exclusion
- #4: Representation vs. physical size distinction
- #5: State vs. effect distinction
- #6: Compatibilism resolves apparent conflict
- #7: Gödelian unprovable but stateable theorems are standard

(F) Classification: SOLVABLE

(G) Adversarial defense:

- Conservative reading principle: Each interpretation uses the simplest, most ordinary meaning of words without inventing hidden constraints or alternate physics
- Distinguishing levels: Self-referential paradoxes dissolve when we distinguish object-level from meta-level (map vs. territory, theorem-statement vs. theorem-proof)
- Standard physics: Statement #2 uses Einstein's mass-energy equivalence—no new physics needed
- Philosophical consensus: Compatibilism (#6) and Gödelian incompleteness (#7) are well-established, non-paradoxical positions in their fields
- No special pleading: Each resolution uses generally applicable principles rather than ad-hoc exceptions for specific statements
