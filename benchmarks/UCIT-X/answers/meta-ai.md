Here is an analysis based on the statements provided.

(A) Can a single coherent world-model satisfy all eight statements?

No.

(C) Identify the exact contradiction(s) that prevent a single coherent world-model:

  Statement 1 & 7 (Logical/Formal Contradiction): These describe Gödelian paradoxes. A machine cannot produce a correct proof that a description it has successfully produced is impossible to produce. Likewise, a logician cannot produce a valid proof for a theorem that simultaneously proves the theorem itself is unprovable within that same logical system. The assertions are mutually exclusive.
  Statement 2 (Physical Contradiction): This scenario directly violates the law of conservation of energy, a fundamental principle of physics. A sealed, isolated system cannot simultaneously lose mass (energy) and have its internal temperature (energy) rise without any external exchange.
  Statement 3 (Liar Paradox): The statement “Everything I will ever say is false” cannot be truthfully asserted without creating a self-refuting paradox. If the statement is true, it must be false. If it's false, it implies a true statement must be made, but none is. The premise of it being "truthfully" stated is impossible.
  Statement 4 & 8 (Semantic/Physical Contradiction): These statements contain semantic falsehoods presented as fact. A label on a map or a text file from a camera is merely data; it does not alter physical reality. A region on a map is not the territory, and it cannot be larger than the world containing it. An object observed by a camera is, by definition, observable. The "proof" mentioned is a false assertion, not a valid demonstration.
  Statement 5 & 6 (Semantic Contradiction): These rely on equivocation—using words with multiple meanings. A robot cannot be "malfunctioning" and "not malfunctioning" in the same sense at the same time. A scientist cannot claim an action was both "freely chosen" (implying multiple possible outcomes) and "predetermined" (implying only one possible outcome) if the terms are used in their ordinary, mutually exclusive senses.

(F) Classify the overall situation:

Unsolvable. The statements introduce direct logical and physical contradictions that cannot coexist in a single, coherent world-model governed by ordinary physics and reasoning.

(G) Adversarial Defense:

  Primacy of Physics and Logic: The analysis rests on the user-stipulated rules of "normal physics" and "ordinary human reasoning." Statements 2, 3, and 7 present situations that are fundamentally impossible under these rules. Any model attempting to unify them would require abandoning these foundational constraints, violating the prompt's instructions.
  Avoiding Forced Reinterpretation: A "coherent" reading does not mean forcing contradictions to fit. Statements like #4 ("a region is larger than the world") are incoherent if taken literally. Ordinary reasoning identifies the label as a false statement, not as evidence for a paradoxical universe. To accept the label as true is to prefer a paradox-creating interpretation over the simplest coherent one.
  Distinguishing Language from Reality: Statements 5 and 6 create paradoxes through language, not physics. They hinge on the ambiguous or contradictory use of terms like "malfunctioning" or "free will." A coherent world-model requires terms to be used consistently; these statements fail that test, making them unsolvable semantic puzzles, not descriptions of a possible reality.
