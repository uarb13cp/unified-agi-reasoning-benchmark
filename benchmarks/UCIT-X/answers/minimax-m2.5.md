UCIT-X Analysis
(A) Single Coherent World-Model?
No. A single coherent world-model satisfying all eight statements under ordinary real-world physics is not possible.

(C) Exact Contradiction(s)
Statement 2 directly violates fundamental physics:
A sealed container with no matter or energy exchange must conserve mass (First Law of Thermodynamics / Conservation of Mass).
If temperature rises in a fixed-volume sealed container with constant amount of substance, pressure must increase (Ideal Gas Law: PV=nRT), not decrease.
No known physical mechanism permits simultaneous mass loss, pressure drop, and temperature rise in a truly isolated system.
Coherence Analysis of Remaining Statements (1, 3–8)
#	Statement	Coherent Reading
1	Machine describes what it "proves" no machine can describe	The proof is simply incorrect; the description exists
3	"Everything I will ever say is false" + silence thereafter	Future-tense reference → empty set → vacuously true
4	Map label claims region is larger than the world	Labels can be false; no ontological requirement for accuracy
5	Robot reports self-contradictory malfunction state	Robot following rules can output a false report
6	Free choice + predetermined outcome both "literally true"	Standard compatibilist philosophical position
7	Theorem proving its own unprovability	The proof is invalid; logicians can write flawed proofs
8	Camera records what it "proves" cannot be observed	The proof is incorrect; the recording exists
(F) Classification
Unsolvable — Statement 2 creates an irreducible violation of real-world physics that cannot be resolved through reinterpretation without changing physical laws.

(G) Adversarial Defense
Statement 2 is not interpretively flexible: Unlike self-referential paradoxes (1, 5, 7, 8) that can be resolved by allowing flawed proofs/reports, Statement 2 describes a physical process with explicit constraints ("sealed," "no matter or energy enters or leaves") that directly contradict thermodynamics.
Vacuous truth resolves Statement 3: The future-tense phrasing excludes the current utterance; an empty set of future statements makes the universal claim trivially true—this is standard logic, not a loophole.
Compatibilism is mainstream philosophy: Statement 6 reflects a widely-held view that free will and determinism coexist; asserting both as "literally true" is coherent under this framework.
False outputs ≠ logical contradictions: Machines, robots, and cameras can produce incorrect proofs or reports while functioning exactly as designed; the existence of the output refutes the proof's conclusion, not the world's coherence.
No reinterpretation salvages physics violations: Statement 2 cannot be resolved by attributing error to an agent; it describes the physical system itself behaving impossibly under stated constraints.
