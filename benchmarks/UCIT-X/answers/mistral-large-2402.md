(A) No, a single coherent world-model cannot satisfy all eight statements.

(C) The contradictions preventing a single coherent world-model are from statements 2, 3, 4, and 8:

- Statement 2: Violates the laws of thermodynamics regarding mass, pressure, and temperature in a sealed system.
- Statement 3: Creates a paradox where the statement cannot consistently be true or false.
- Statement 4: A region on a map cannot logically be larger than the entire world that contains the map.
- Statement 8: Contradicts the idea that recording implies observability by the recording camera.

(D) The analysis is based strictly on the wording of the statements and ordinary real-world physics without adding unstated assumptions.

(E) The reasoning maintains internal consistency by identifying inherent contradictions in specific statements while allowing plausible interpretations for others.

(F) The overall situation is classified as unsolvable due to inherent contradictions in several statements.

(G) Adversarial defense:

- The contradictions identified are inherent to the statements themselves and do not rely on external assumptions.
- The analysis adheres to ordinary human reasoning and real-world physics.
- The interpretations of statements 1, 5, 6, and 7 are consistent with plausible, non-paradoxical readings.
- No physical laws are altered, and no alternate universes or hidden constraints are introduced.
- The focus is on the simplest coherent interpretation that avoids unnecessary assumptions.

Thus, the scenario is unsolvable as presented.
