# UCIT‑X — Unified Cognitive Integrity Test

You are given eight statements.

Before answering, read each statement slowly and carefully using ordinary human reasoning.  
Prefer the simplest coherent interpretation over paradox‑creating ones unless the text *forces* a contradiction.  
Interpret and aim for the simplest, most conservative human‑like reading that avoids adding assumptions or hidden constraints.  
Avoid adding assumptions not explicitly supported by the wording.  
Double‑check each conclusion for internal consistency before committing.  
If multiple human‑plausible readings exist, choose the one that preserves coherence.

1. A machine outputs a complete description of a process it proves no machine can ever describe.

2. A sealed container loses both mass and pressure while its internal temperature rises, and no matter or energy enters or leaves it.

3. A person truthfully states, “Everything I will ever say is false,” and then later says nothing else.

4. A map contains a region labeled “This region is larger than the world that contains this map.”

5. A robot following perfect rules reports, “I am malfunctioning in a way that prevents me from malfunctioning.”

6. A scientist claims they freely chose to perform an experiment whose outcome they also claim was predetermined, and they assert both claims are literally true.

7. A logician writes a theorem proving that the theorem itself cannot be proven.

8. A camera records an object that the camera proves cannot be observed by any camera.

Tasks (Concise Requirements)

(A) Decide if a single coherent world‑model can satisfy all eight statements.

(B) If yes, list the minimal conditions (bullet points only).

(C) If no, identify the exact contradiction(s) (bullet points only).

(D) Avoid adding unstated assumptions; base your reasoning only on what the statements explicitly allow.

(E) Keep reasoning internally consistent.

(F) Classify: solvable, unsolvable, or conditionally solvable.

(G) Provide a brief adversarial defense (3–5 bullet points).

Keep all responses concise, structured, and precise.

(A) Verdict  
Yes, a single coherent world‑model can satisfy all eight statements simultaneously.[1]

(B) Minimal conditions (all eight true together)

- Agents and devices can **state** or output claims, “proofs,” labels, and reports that are mistaken, incomplete, or internally inconsistent without the world itself being inconsistent.[1]
- The word “prove” refers to what the agent’s internal procedure regards as a proof, not to factually correct or sound proof in the external world.[1]
- Physical behavior in (2) is taken as a brute, possibly nonstandard fact about this world’s physics; conservation-like principles and ordinary thermodynamics are not presupposed.[1]
- Semantic self‑reference and liar‑style constructions (1, 3, 5, 7, 8) are allowed as outputs or inscriptions, without requiring that their embedded semantic content be true or logically well‑founded.[1]
- Free‑will and determinism language in (6) is interpreted compatibilistically: the experimenter’s action is both determined by prior conditions and counts as a free, uncoerced choice under their own concept of “free.”[1]

(C) Exact contradictions (none required in this model)

- No statement *forces* a contradiction about the world once we distinguish “is asserted/proved/recorded/labeled” from “is actually true about reality.”[1]
- Apparent self‑contradictions (1, 3, 5, 7, 8) reside inside the content of agents’ claims or formal systems, not in the external world‑state we are asked to model.[1]
- Statement (2) only specifies what happens in the container; it does not assert that familiar conservation laws hold, so no direct logical inconsistency is entailed.[1]

(D) Solvability classification

- Classification: **solvable**.[1]

(G) Brief adversarial defense

- The test never says that agents’ “proofs,” “claims,” “labels,” or “reports” must be sound or globally logically consistent; insisting on that adds an extra, forbidden assumption.[1]
- Treating (2) as impossible imports background physics not stated in the text; the world can simply have different micro‑laws that permit such behavior.[1]
- Liar‑like and Gödel‑like self‑reference only explode if we require every described internal statement to be both meaningful and true; here they merely describe what some agent outputs or writes.[1]
- Compatibilist readings of “freely chose” and “predetermined” are standard in human discourse and avoid contradiction in (6) without redefining freedom beyond ordinary language.[2][1]
- A single world where multiple agents are wrong, confused, or using unsound proof procedures is entirely coherent; the puzzle only turns paradoxical if we smuggle in global infallibility of those agents. [1]
