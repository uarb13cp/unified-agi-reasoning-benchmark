(A) **No**, a single coherent world-model cannot satisfy all eight statements.

(C) **Exact Contradictions:**
*   **Statement 3 (Logical Impossibility):** Asserts a person "truthfully states" a liar paradox ("Everything I will ever say is false"). For the statement to be truthful, it must be false; for it to be false, it must be true. This violates the Law of Non-Contradiction under ordinary logic.
*   **Statement 2 (Physical Impossibility):** Describes a closed system (no matter/energy exchange) losing mass and pressure while temperature rises. Under normal physics and ordinary interpretive norms (conservation of mass/energy), a sealed system cannot lose mass without matter/energy leaving, and temperature/pressure dynamics violate thermodynamic laws in this configuration.
*   **Statements 1, 5, 7, 8 (Performative Contradictions):** Each asserts an entity successfully performs an action (describing, malfunctioning, proving, recording) that is simultaneously defined as impossible by the entity's own valid output/proof. This creates a logical loop where the success of the action invalidates the conditions allowing the action.

(F) **Classification:** **Unsolvable**

(G) **Adversarial Defense:**
*   **Constraint Adherence:** The prompt mandates "normal physics" and "ordinary human interpretive norms," which preclude resolving Statement 2 via relativistic mass-energy conversion or Statement 3 via non-classical logic.
*   **Textual Force:** Statements like "truthfully states" and "it proves" assert objective validity, preventing reinterpretation as "claims to prove" or "lies" without rewriting the scenarios (forbidden by constraints).
*   **Logical Priority:** Even if physical contradictions (Stmt 2) were resolved, the logical contradictions (Stmt 3) remain absolute barriers to coherence in any world-model adhering to standard logic.
*   **Universal Quantifiers:** Statements 1 and 8 use "no machine" and "any camera," making the subsequent success of *that* machine/camera a direct negation of the established proof, creating an unavoidable A ∧ ¬A structure.
*   **Consistency Requirement:** Task (E) requires internal consistency across all eight; since even one statement (e.g., Stmt 3) is logically impossible under the constraints, the set as a whole is unsatisfiable.
