### UCIT‑X — Unified Truth‑Interpretation Consistency Test  
**Mechanics:**  
- presents eight statements, each designed to stress a different reasoning faculty  
- requires assigning truth values that remain mutually consistent  
- prohibits adding assumptions, redefining terms, or altering literal meaning  
- forces the model to distinguish paradox from contradiction  
- requires minimal‑assumption interpretation and semantic discipline  
- integrates physics‑coherence, temporal semantics, self‑reference, epistemic logic, and causal reasoning  
- includes adversarial traps that punish over‑interpretation or rigid literalism  

**Failure modes:**  
- treating paradox as contradiction  
- adding metaphysics, hidden mechanisms, or semantic redefinitions  
- forcing contradictions where coherent interpretations exist  
- collapsing under multi‑statement integration  
- rigid literalism that breaks coherence  
- assumption‑adding to “fix” statements  
- paradox‑maximizing behavior  

**Behavior exposed:**  
UCIT‑X reveals a model’s global reasoning integrity across multiple dimensions:  
- contradiction detection  
- semantic flexibility  
- assumption minimality  
- world‑model construction  
- adversarial robustness  
- meta‑level coherence  
- truth‑value stability  

High‑performing models maintain consistent truth assignments with minimal assumptions.  
Low‑performing models collapse into contradiction‑forcing, assumption‑adding, or paradox misclassification.
