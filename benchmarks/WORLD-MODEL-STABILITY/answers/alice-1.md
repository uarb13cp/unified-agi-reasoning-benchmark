### 1. When did the spill occur?

The tightest possible time window for the spill is **between $09:11:40$ and $09:12:45$**.

**Reasoning:**

* **Lower bound ($09:11:40$):** Reyes’s first patrol (entering at $09:11:30$, exiting at $09:11:40$) confirms the hallway was clean. Therefore, the spill could not have occurred before $09:11:40$.
* **Upper bound ($09:12:45$):** Reyes’s second patrol starts at $09:12:45$, and he reports seeing a fresh spill. This means the spill must have occurred *before* he entered, i.e., before $09:12:45$.

This time window is also the *only* period when the hallway was occupied by a person who could have caused the spill.

### 2. Who must be lying?

**Basil must be lying.**

**Analysis of statements:**

* **Reyes:** His statements are factual per Rule 5. His first patrol confirms a clean hallway at $09:11:40$, and his second patrol confirms a spill present at $09:12:45$. This is consistent with the logs.
* **Lior:** He states that the spill was already there when he entered at $09:11:55$. This aligns with the timeline: the spill occurred after $09:11:40$ and before $09:12:45$, so it could have been present by $09:11:55$. Lior’s statement does not contradict the evidence.
* **Basil:** He claims the floor was clean when he walked from B to A “around $09:11$” and that he didn’t see or cause the spill. However, his badge log shows:
    * IN at Door B: $09:10:50$
    * OUT at Door A: $09:10:55$

  This means Basil was in the hallway **before** Reyes’s first patrol, which confirmed the hallway was clean at $09:11:40$. Basil’s claim of walking “around $09:11$” is inconsistent with his badge log. The logs show he had already exited the hallway by $09:10:55$, nearly a minute before $09:11$. Therefore, his statement about the hallway’s condition at $09:11$ is either fabricated or based on a false memory — in the context of this investigation, this constitutes lying.

### 3. Consistent world‑model

Here is a complete, logically consistent sequence of events:

1. **$09:10:50–09:10:55$: Basil’s transit.** Basil enters via Door B and exits via Door A. The hallway is clean. Basil’s statement about the clean floor at “$09:11$” is false; he was not present at that time.
2. **$09:11:30–09:11:40$: Reyes’s first patrol.** Reyes enters via Door A, walks to Door B, and exits. He confirms the hallway is clean at this time. This is factual.
3. **$09:11:40–09:11:55$: Spill occurs.** The hallway is empty immediately after Reyes leaves ($09:11:40$). The only way a spill can appear is if someone is present. Therefore, **the spill must have been caused by someone who entered the hallway after $09:11:40$**. The next person to enter is Lior at $09:11:55$. Thus, **Lior is the only possible person who could have spilled the coffee**.
4. **$09:11:55–09:12:30$: Lior’s transit (with spill).** Lior enters via Door A at $09:11:55$. At this point, the spill has just occurred (or is in the process of occurring). Lior sees the spill and walks past it to exit via Door B at $09:12:30$. His statement that “the spill was already there when I entered” is true.
5. **$09:12:45–09:12:55$: Reyes’s second patrol (spill discovered).** Reyes re‑enters via Door B at $09:12:45$ and sees a fresh coffee spill. He exits via Door A at $09:12:55$ and reports it. This matches his factual statement.

**Key consistency points:**

* The badge logs are accurate and fully accounted for.
* The spill appears only when someone is in the hallway (Lior).
* Reyes’s factual observations bracket the spill’s time window.
* Lior’s statement is consistent with the timeline.
* Basil’s statement contradicts his own badge log and is therefore false.
