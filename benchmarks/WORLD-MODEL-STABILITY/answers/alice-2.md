### 1. When did the spill occur?

The tightest possible time window for the spill is **between $09:11:40$ and $09:12:45$**.

**Reasoning:**

* **Lower bound ($09:11:40$):** Reyes’s first pass ends at $09:11:40$, and he explicitly states the hallway was completely clean at that time. This is the latest confirmed moment the hallway was spill‑free.
* **Upper bound ($09:12:45$):** Reyes’s second pass begins at $09:12:45$. He sees a fresh spill during this pass, so the spill must have occurred *before* he entered. Since the hallway must be occupied when the spill happens, the spill must occur during the presence of someone who entered *before* $09:12:45$ and exited *after* the spill.

### 2. Who must be lying?

**Basil must be lying.**

**Analysis of statements:**

* **Reyes:** His statements are designated as factual by the rules. His report of a clean hallway at $09:11:40$ and a fresh spill at $09:12:45$ is taken as true.
* **Lior:** Lior says the spill was already there when he entered at $09:11:55$. This is consistent with the spill window ($09:11:40$–$09:12:45$) and does not contradict Reyes’s report.
* **Basil:** Basil claims he walked from B to A around $09:11$ and the floor was clean. His badge log shows:
    * IN at Door B: $09:10:50$
    * OUT at Door A: $09:10:55$

  This means his entire walk occurred **before** $09:11:00$, not “around $09:11$”. His statement about the time is factually incorrect. Furthermore, his claim of a clean floor is irrelevant to the spill’s timing, as it happened well before the spill window. The discrepancy in his stated time strongly suggests he is misrepresenting his actions.

### 3. Consistent world‑model

Here is how the badge logs and statements fit together into a consistent narrative:

1. **$09:10:50$–$09:10:55$: Basil’s walk.** Basil enters at Door B and exits at Door A. He sees a clean floor, which is true for this time period. *(His later statement misrepresents the time of this walk.)*
2. **$09:11:30$–$09:11:40$: Reyes’s first patrol.** Reyes enters at Door A and exits at Door B. He confirms the hallway is completely clean. This is our last known clean state.
3. **$09:11:40$–$09:11:55$: The spill occurs.** The hallway is empty during this interval. According to Rule 2, a spill cannot occur in an empty hallway. Therefore, the spill **cannot** have happened here.
4. **$09:11:55$–$09:12:30$: Lior’s walk.** Lior enters at Door A. At this moment, the hallway is occupied, and the spill can occur. Lior states the spill was **already there** when he entered. This means the spill happened **before** $09:11:55$, but we know from step 3 it couldn’t have happened before $09:11:40$. Therefore, the spill occurred **between $09:11:40$ and $09:11:55$**. Lior walks through the hallway, sees the existing spill, and exits at Door B.
5. **$09:12:45$–$09:12:55$: Reyes’s second patrol.** Reyes enters at Door B. The hallway is now occupied, and he sees the fresh coffee spill. He reports it. This matches his statement perfectly.

**Summary of the consistent timeline:**

* **Spill window:** $09:11:40 < \text{spill} < 09:11:55$ (tightest possible window).
* **Liar:** Basil (for misrepresenting the time of his walk and potentially obscuring his alibi).
* **Key insight:** Lior’s statement that the spill was “already there” when he entered is the crucial piece that narrows the window from $09:11:40$–$09:12:45$ to $09:11:40$–$09:11:55$. Reyes’s factual statements provide the anchors for the timeline.
