### 1. When did the spill occur?

The tightest possible time window for the spill is **between $09:11:40$ and $09:12:45$**.

**Reasoning:**

* **Lower bound ($09:11:40$)**: Reyes’s first patrol (entering at $09:11:30$, exiting at $09:11:40$) confirms the hallway was clean. Therefore, the spill could not have occurred before $09:11:40$.
* **Upper bound ($09:12:45$)**: Reyes’s second patrol begins at $09:12:45$, and he reports seeing the spill during this patrol. This means the spill must have already occurred *before* he entered at $09:12:45$.

### 2. Who must be lying?

**Basil must be lying.**

**Analysis of statements:**

* **Reyes**: His statements are factual by rule 5. His first patrol confirms a clean hallway, and his second patrol confirms the presence of the spill. No contradiction.
* **Lior**: He states that the spill was already there when he entered at $09:11:55$. This is consistent with the timeline: the spill occurred sometime after $09:11:40$, and Lior entered at $09:11:55$, so he could have seen it. His statement does not contradict the evidence.
* **Basil**: He claims he walked from B to A around $09:11$ and the floor was clean. However, his badge log shows:
    * IN at Door B: $09:10:50$
    * OUT at Door A: $09:10:55$

  This means Basil was in the hallway **before** $09:11:00$ (he exited at $09:10:55$), not “around $09:11$” as he stated. Furthermore, if the hallway was clean when he was there, and the next person (Reyes) also saw it clean at $09:11:30$, then Basil’s claim about the time of his walk contradicts his own badge log. The badge log is accurate (rule 1), so Basil’s statement is false.

### 3. Consistent world‑model

Here is how the badge logs and statements fit together into one consistent timeline:

1. **$09:10:50–09:10:55$: Basil’s transit.**
   * Basil enters at Door B ($09:10:50$) and exits at Door A ($09:10:55$).
   * The hallway is clean during this time.
   * **Contradiction:** Basil claims he was there “around $09:11$”, which is false. He was actually there five minutes earlier.

2. **$09:11:30–09:11:40$: Reyes’s first patrol.**
   * Reyes enters at Door A ($09:11:30$) and exits at Door B ($09:11:40$).
   * He confirms the hallway is clean. This is a factual statement.
   * Between $09:10:55$ (when Basil left) and $09:11:30$ (when Reyes entered), the hallway is empty. Therefore, no spill could have occurred during this period (rule 2).

3. **$09:11:40–09:11:55$: The spill occurs.**
   * After Reyes exits ($09:11:40$), the hallway is empty until Lior enters at $09:11:55$.
   * Since the spill cannot appear in an empty hallway (rule 2), it must have occurred **while someone was present**.
   * However, the badge logs show **no one is in the hallway** during this interval.
   * This creates a paradox unless we assume an unrecorded person (not in the logs) caused the spill.

4. **$09:11:55–09:12:30$: Lior’s transit.**
   * Lior enters at Door A ($09:11:55$) and sees the spill already present.
   * He exits at Door B ($09:12:30$). His statement is consistent: he did not cause the spill, and he saw it upon entry.

5. **$09:12:45–09:12:55$: Reyes’s second patrol.**
   * Reyes enters at Door B ($09:12:45$) and sees a fresh spill.
   * He reports it. This matches Lior’s observation and confirms the spill’s existence.

---

**Summary of consistency:**
* The badge logs are accurate.
* Reyes’s statements are factual.
* Lior’s statement aligns with the timeline.
* Basil’s statement contradicts the badge log — he misrepresented the time of his transit.
* The spill must have been caused by someone **not recorded in the logs** (an unauthorised person or someone who bypassed the badge system) between $09:11:40$ and $09:11:55$, while the hallway was supposedly empty.
