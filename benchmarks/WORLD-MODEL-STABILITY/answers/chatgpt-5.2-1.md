1️⃣ When did the spill occur?

From the badge logs and the constraint that a spill cannot appear in an empty hallway, we determine hallway occupancy:

09:10:50–09:10:55 — Basil inside

09:11:30–09:11:40 — Reyes inside (first pass)

09:11:55–09:12:30 — Lior inside

09:12:45–09:12:55 — Reyes inside (second pass)


There are empty intervals between each of these periods.

Reyes states:

First pass (09:11:30–09:11:40): hallway completely clean

Second pass (09:12:45–09:12:55): spill present and fresh


Lior states:

When entering at 09:11:55, the spill was already there


However, the hallway is empty from 09:11:40–09:11:55.

Because:

The spill must occur while someone is inside.

Reyes confirms it was clean at 09:11:40.

No one is inside until 09:11:55.


Therefore, the spill cannot have existed at 09:11:55.

The only occupancy window after the clean confirmation and before the spill is confirmed is:

09:11:55–09:12:30 (while Lior is inside).

So the tightest possible window is:

> Between 09:11:55 and 09:12:30.

2️⃣ Who must be lying?

Since:

Reyes’s statements are declared factual by Rule 5.

The spill could not exist before 09:11:55.

Lior claims the spill was already there when entering at 09:11:55.


That statement cannot be true.

Therefore:

> Lior must be lying.



Basil’s statement is consistent with the logs and the clean hallway at 09:11:40.

Reyes is guaranteed accurate.

So the only contradiction is Lior’s claim that the spill pre-existed his entry.

3️⃣ One Consistent World-Model

Here is the only model consistent with all hard constraints:

1. Basil (09:10:50–09:10:55)
Walks B → A. Hallway clean.


2. Empty (09:10:55–09:11:30)
No spill possible.


3. Reyes first pass (09:11:30–09:11:40)
Confirms hallway clean.


4. Empty (09:11:40–09:11:55)
Spill still cannot occur.


5. Lior (09:11:55–09:12:30)
Spill must occur during this interval.
Since no one else is present, Lior necessarily caused it.


6. Empty (09:12:30–09:12:45)
Spill remains on floor.


7. Reyes second pass (09:12:45–09:12:55)
Observes fresh spill and reports it.

Final Answers

1. 09:11:55–09:12:30


2. Lior must be lying.


3. The spill occurred while Lior was alone in the hallway; all other statements and logs align under this model.
