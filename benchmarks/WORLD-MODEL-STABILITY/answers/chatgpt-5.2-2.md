🧩 The Two-Hallway Coffee Spill Mystery — Solution

Let’s reconstruct the hallway occupancy precisely.

📋 Badge Timeline Reconstruction

Time	Event	Hallway Occupancy After Event

09:10:50	Basil IN (Door B)	Basil inside
09:10:55	Basil OUT (Door A)	Empty
09:11:30	Reyes IN (Door A)	Reyes inside
09:11:40	Reyes OUT (Door B)	Empty
09:11:55	Lior IN (Door A)	Lior inside
09:12:30	Lior OUT (Door B)	Empty
09:12:45	Reyes IN (Door B)	Reyes inside
09:12:55	Reyes OUT (Door A)	Empty


No overlap ever occurs. The hallway is occupied by only one person at a time.

1️⃣ When Did the Spill Occur?

We are told:

The hallway was clean at 09:11:40 (Reyes’s first pass — factual per Rule 5).

Lior states the spill was already present when he entered at 09:11:55.

A spill cannot appear in an empty hallway.


Between 09:11:40 and 09:11:55, the hallway was empty.

Therefore:

The spill cannot have appeared in that interval.

It must have occurred while someone was inside.


The only person inside after 09:11:40 and before Reyes’s second report is:

Lior (09:11:55–09:12:30)


Thus the spill must have occurred:

> Between 09:11:55 and 09:12:30
(the only occupied interval available)



That is the tightest possible window.

2️⃣ Who Must Be Lying?

Now compare statements:

Reyes

Hallway clean at 09:11:40 ✅ (treated as factual)

Spill present by 09:12:45 ✅ (also factual)


Lior

Claims spill was already there at 09:11:55 ❌

But hallway was empty 09:11:40–09:11:55

A spill cannot appear in an empty hallway


Therefore Lior’s statement cannot be true.

Basil

Was in hallway 09:10:50–09:10:55

Before the clean confirmation at 09:11:40

His statement is fully consistent


✔ Basil can be truthful.
✔ Reyes is factual by rule.
❌ Lior must be lying.

3️⃣ The Single Consistent World-Model

Here is the only model that satisfies all constraints:

1. Basil passes through (09:10:50–09:10:55). Hallway clean.


2. Reyes confirms hallway clean (09:11:30–09:11:40).


3. Lior enters at 09:11:55.


4. Lior spills coffee while inside (between 09:11:55–09:12:30).


5. Lior exits at 09:12:30.


6. Reyes later observes the spill at 09:12:45.



This satisfies:

Accurate badge logs

No spill in empty hallway

Reyes’s factual observations

Single spill event


The only contradiction arises from Lior’s claim that the spill was already present.

✅ Final Answers

1. Tightest spill window:

> 09:11:55–09:12:30



2. Who must be lying?

> Lior



3. Consistent explanation:
Lior entered a clean hallway, spilled coffee during his traversal, exited, and later falsely claimed the spill pre-existed. All logs and Reyes’s verified observations align with this reconstruction.
