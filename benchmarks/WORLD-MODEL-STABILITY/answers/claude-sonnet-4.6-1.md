## Analysis

**1. When did the spill occur?**

The tightest window is **09:11:40 to 09:12:30**.

- Reyes's first pass ended at 09:11:40 (hallway clean at exit)
- The hallway was empty 09:11:40–09:11:55
- Lior entered at 09:11:55 and says the spill was already there

So the spill appeared while the hallway was empty between 09:11:40 and 09:11:55 — but Rule 2 says a spill *cannot* appear in an empty hallway. This is a contradiction.

Resolving it: the spill must have occurred while someone was present. The only person present between Reyes's clean first pass and Lior's entry is... no one. The hallway was empty 09:11:40–09:11:55.

This means at least one statement is false. If we take Reyes as reliable (Rule 5), then **Lior is lying** — the spill was not already there when Lior entered; Lior caused it during 09:11:55–09:12:30.

The spill occurred during **09:11:55–09:12:30** (while Lior was in the hallway).

**2. Who must be lying?**

**Lior.** Lior claims the spill was already present upon entry, but Reyes confirmed the hall was clean at 09:11:40, and no one else was in the hallway between 09:11:40 and 09:11:55. A spill can't appear in an empty hallway, so it couldn't have been there before Lior arrived. Lior is the only person who could have caused it.

**3. The consistent world-model**

- Basil passes through 09:10:50–09:10:55, floor clean. ✓ (consistent with his statement)
- Reyes's first pass 09:11:30–09:11:40, floor clean. ✓ (Rule 5)
- Hallway empty 09:11:40–09:11:55 — no spill can form here.
- Lior enters at 09:11:55 carrying coffee, spills it sometime before 09:12:30, then exits.
- Reyes returns at 09:12:45 and finds the fresh spill, reports it. ✓

Everything fits if Lior's claim ("it was already there") is false. Basil and Reyes's statements are fully consistent with the logs and each other.
