## Analysis

**1. When did the spill occur?**

The tightest window is **09:11:40 to 09:12:45**.

- Reyes's first pass ends at 09:11:40 with the hallway clean (factual per Rule 5).
- Reyes's second pass begins at 09:12:45 and the spill is already there.
- The hallway is occupied only by Lior during 09:11:55–09:12:30, which falls inside this window.
- Between 09:11:40 and 09:11:55, the hallway is **empty** — so by Rule 2, no spill can appear then.

Therefore the spill must have occurred while Lior was present: **09:11:55 to 09:12:30**.

**2. Who must be lying?**

**Lior** is lying (or mistaken, but given the constraints, lying). Lior claims the spill was already there when they entered at 09:11:55, but Reyes — whose statements are factual — found the hallway clean at 09:11:40. No one else was in the hallway between 09:11:40 and 09:11:55, and Rule 2 means the spill can't appear in an empty hallway. So the spill could not have pre-dated Lior's entry. Lior is the only person present during the window in which the spill must have occurred.

**3. The consistent world-model**

Basil passes through 09:10:50–09:10:55 — floor clean, no issue. Reyes does a first sweep 09:11:30–09:11:40 and confirms the hallway is spotless. The hallway is then briefly empty (09:11:40–09:11:55). Lior enters at 09:11:55, spills coffee at some point during their transit, and exits at 09:12:30. Lior's claim that the spill was pre-existing is contradicted by Reyes's verified clean observation just 15 seconds before Lior entered, with no one in between who could have caused it. Reyes's second pass at 09:12:45 finds the fresh spill and reports it. Everything fits except Lior's alibi statement.
