## Analysis

**1. When did the spill occur?**

The tightest window is **09:11:40 to 09:12:30**.

Here's why: Reyes's first pass ended at 09:11:40 with the hallway clean. Lior entered at 09:11:55 and claims the spill was already there. But between 09:11:40 and 09:11:55, the hallway was empty — and a spill can't appear in an empty hallway. So Lior's claim is impossible unless the spill occurred during Lior's own presence (09:11:55–09:12:30). The spill must have occurred **during Lior's traversal**, meaning the window is **09:11:55 to 09:12:30**.

**2. Who must be lying?**

**Lior** is lying (or mistaken, but given the logical impossibility, lying is the necessary conclusion).

Lior claims "the spill was already there when I entered." But the hallway was confirmed clean at 09:11:40 (Reyes's exit), and no one was in the hallway between 09:11:40 and Lior's entry at 09:11:55. A spill cannot materialize in an empty hallway. Therefore, Lior could not have entered to find a pre-existing spill. The spill must have occurred while Lior was inside, making Lior the most probable cause — and Lior's statement is false.

**3. Consistent world-model**

Basil walks A→B... wait, B→A (09:10:50–09:10:55), finds the floor clean. Consistent with all evidence; no reason to doubt.

Reyes's first pass (09:11:30–09:11:40) confirms a clean hallway on exit. Reyes's second pass (09:12:45–09:12:55) finds the spill. Both are treated as factual per Rule 5.

The hallway is empty from 09:11:40 to 09:11:55. No spill can appear here.

Lior enters at 09:11:55 and exits at 09:12:30. This is the **only window** in which someone is present and the spill could have occurred. Lior's statement that it was pre-existing contradicts the physical impossibility established by Reyes's clean first pass + the empty hallway gap. Everything fits if Lior caused the spill during transit and lied about it.
