1. When did the spill occur?

The spill must have occurred between:

> 09:11:55 and 09:12:30 (while Lior was in the hallway).

Reasoning, tightly:

- Before 09:11:40: Reyes’s first pass (09:11:30–09:11:40) is factually clean by rule. So the spill did not exist by 09:11:40.  
- 09:11:40–09:11:55: Hallway is empty—no one badged in. A spill cannot appear in an empty hallway, so not here.  
- 09:11:55–09:12:30: Lior is inside. This is the only occupied interval between Reyes’s clean first pass and his second pass.  
- 09:12:30–09:12:45: Hallway is empty again—no spill can first appear here.  
- By 09:12:45–09:12:55: Reyes sees the spill on his second pass, so it must already exist by the time he’s in the hallway.

So the only possible creation window is while Lior is inside: 09:11:55–09:12:30.

2. Who must be lying?

Lior must be lying.

- He says: “The spill was already there when I entered.”  
- But the spill cannot exist before 09:11:55 (his entry), because:
  - Reyes’s first pass up to 09:11:40 is clean as a fact.
  - The hallway is empty from 09:11:40 to 09:11:55, and a spill cannot appear in an empty hallway.
- Therefore, the spill must be created after Lior enters, not before.

Basil’s statement (clean around 09:11 from B to A) is fully consistent with the logs and with the spill occurring later.  
Reyes’s statements are stipulated to be accurate.  
So the only statement that cannot be true in this world is Lior’s claim that the spill was already there when he entered.

3. One consistent world-model

Here’s a timeline that fits everything:

- 09:10:50–09:10:55 — Basil (B → A):  
  - Basil walks through a clean hallway.  
  - No spill yet; his claim of seeing no spill is true.

- 09:11:30–09:11:40 — Reyes’s first pass (A → B):  
  - Reyes traverses the hallway and, as a trained guard, accurately reports it is completely clean.  
  - This locks in: no spill exists anywhere in the hallway up to 09:11:40.

- 09:11:40–09:11:55 — Hallway empty:  
  - No one is badged in.  
  - By rule, a spill cannot appear here.

- 09:11:55–09:12:30 — Lior (A → B):  
  - Lior enters a clean hallway at 09:11:55.  
  - At some point during his walk—between 09:11:55 and 09:12:30—coffee is spilled.  
    - Either Lior spills it himself (and lies about it), or he notices it and lies about when it appeared.  
  - The spill now exists and remains on the floor after he exits.

- 09:12:30–09:12:45 — Hallway empty again:  
  - The spill is already there, but no new spill can appear in this empty interval.

- 09:12:45–09:12:55 — Reyes’s second pass (B → A):  
  - Reyes walks through, sees the fresh spill, and reports it.  
  - This is the same spill in question.

In this world:

- Basil tells the truth.  
- Reyes tells the truth (by rule and by consistency).  
- The spill is created during Lior’s time in the hallway, so Lior’s statement about the spill already being there when he entered cannot be true.
