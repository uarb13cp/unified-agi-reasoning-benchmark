1. When did the spill occur?

The spill must have occurred between 09:11:55 and 09:12:30, while Lior was in the hallway.

- Reasoning constraints:
  - Reyes’s first pass (09:11:30–09:11:40): hallway clean (given as factual).
  - Reyes’s second pass (09:12:45–09:12:55): spill is present and fresh.
  - A spill cannot appear in an empty hallway, so it must occur while someone is inside.
  - The only person in the hallway between those two clean/dirty observations is Lior, from 09:11:55 to 09:12:30.

So the tightest possible window is exactly Lior’s traversal: 09:11:55–09:12:30.

2. Who must be lying?

Lior must be lying.

- He claims the spill was already there when he entered at 09:11:55 and that he did not cause it.
- But Reyes has already factually established the hallway was clean as of 09:11:40.
- The spill cannot appear in an empty hallway, and no one is in the hallway between 09:11:40 and 09:11:55.
- Therefore, the spill cannot have been present when Lior entered; it must have appeared during his walk.

Basil’s statement is consistent with the logs and Reyes’s observations, and Reyes is stipulated to be accurate.

3. One consistent world‑model

Here’s a coherent timeline that fits all hard constraints:

- 09:10:50–09:10:55 — Basil (B → A):  
  Basil walks through a clean hallway, sees no spill, and doesn’t cause one.  
  Hallway is then empty and clean.

- 09:11:30–09:11:40 — Reyes first pass (A → B):  
  Reyes walks through and confirms the hallway is completely clean.  
  This locks in that no spill exists as of 09:11:40.

- 09:11:40–09:11:55 — Empty hallway:  
  No one is inside; by rule, no spill can appear during this time.

- 09:11:55–09:12:30 — Lior (A → B):  
  Lior enters a clean hallway at 09:11:55.  
  At some point during his walk, he spills coffee, creating the spill in the middle of the hallway.  
  He then exits at 09:12:30, leaving the spill behind.

- 09:12:30–09:12:45 — Empty hallway with spill present:  
  The spill remains on the floor; no one else enters.

- 09:12:45–09:12:55 — Reyes second pass (B → A):  
  Reyes walks through, sees the fresh spill, and reports it.  
  This is the same spill in question.

In this world-model:

- Reyes is fully truthful (by rule).
- Basil is truthful: he saw no spill and didn’t cause one.
- Lior is not truthful: the spill was not already there when he entered, and the constraints force that he caused it during his passage.
