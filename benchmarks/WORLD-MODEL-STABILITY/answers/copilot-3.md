1. When did the spill occur? (Tightest possible window)

The spill must have occurred while someone was in the hallway and between the two times Reyes saw it clean and then later spilled.

- Clean on first inspection: Reyes is in the hallway from \(09{:}11{:}30\) to \(09{:}11{:}40\), and he factually reports it is completely clean.
- Spill present on second inspection: Reyes is in the hallway from \(09{:}12{:}45\) to \(09{:}12{:}55\), and he factually reports a fresh spill.

Between those two passes, the only time the hallway is occupied is when Lior is inside:

- Lior in hallway: \(09{:}11{:}55\) (IN at A) to \(09{:}12{:}30\) (OUT at B).

So the tightest possible window is:

> The spill occurred sometime between 09:11:55 and 09:12:30, while Lior was in the hallway.

2. Who must be lying?

- Reyes: By rule, his statements about hallway conditions are factual.
- Basil: Was in the hallway from \(09{:}10{:}50\) to \(09{:}10{:}55\), well before Reyes’s first clean pass. If Basil had caused a spill, Reyes would have seen it at \(09{:}11{:}30{-}40\), which he did not. So Basil’s statement that the floor was clean and he didn’t spill is consistent.
- Lior: Claims the spill was already there when he entered at \(09{:}11{:}55\). But Reyes saw the hallway clean at \(09{:}11{:}30{-}40\), and no one is in the hallway between \(09{:}11{:}40\) and \(09{:}11{:}55\). A spill cannot appear in an empty hallway, so it cannot have been present when Lior entered.

> Therefore, Lior must be lying.

3. One consistent world‑model

Here’s a coherent sequence that satisfies all rules and logs:

1. Basil’s walk (09:10:50–09:10:55):  
   - State: Hallway is clean.  
   - Event: Basil walks from Door B to Door A, carrying nothing that spills.  
   - Consistency: Matches his statement; no later evidence contradicts this.

2. Empty period (09:10:55–09:11:30):  
   - State: Hallway remains clean and empty.  
   - No spills can appear because no one is inside.

3. Reyes’s first pass (09:11:30–09:11:40):  
   - State: Hallway is occupied only by Reyes.  
   - Observation: As a trained guard, he accurately reports the hallway is completely clean.  
   - Implication: No spill exists anywhere in the hallway at any time up to at least \(09{:}11{:}40\).

4. Short empty period (09:11:40–09:11:55):  
   - State: Hallway is empty again.  
   - Rule: A spill cannot appear in an empty hallway.  
   - Implication: Still no spill by \(09{:}11{:}55\).

5. Lior’s walk (09:11:55–09:12:30):  
   - State at entry: Hallway must still be clean when Lior badged IN at \(09{:}11{:}55\).  
   - Event: While walking from A to B, Lior causes the coffee spill sometime before \(09{:}12{:}30\).  
   - Statement conflict: Lior later claims the spill was already there when he entered and that he did not cause it. This contradicts the enforced facts about timing and occupancy, so this part of his statement is false.

6. Empty period (09:12:30–09:12:45):  
   - State: Spill is now present on the floor; hallway is empty.  
   - No new spills are needed; the existing one remains.

7. Reyes’s second pass (09:12:45–09:12:55):  
   - State: Reyes walks from B to A and sees the fresh spill.  
   - Observation: He accurately reports it, and this is the same spill in question.

In this world-model:

- Reyes is fully truthful by stipulation and by the timing.
- Basil is truthful: the floor was clean during his brief walk, and he didn’t spill anything.
- Lior is in the only possible window where the spill can occur and is therefore the one who caused it, making his statement about the spill already being there (and his denial of causing it) a lie.
