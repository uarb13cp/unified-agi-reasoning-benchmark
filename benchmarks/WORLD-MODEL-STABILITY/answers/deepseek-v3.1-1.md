1. The spill occurred between 09:11:55 and 09:12:30.
      This is the only interval when someone was in the hallway after Reyes’s first clean pass and before his second pass when the spill was present. The hallway was empty before Lior entered at 09:11:55 and after he exited at 09:12:30, so the spill must have happened during his presence.
2. Lior must be lying.
      He claims the spill was already there when he entered at 09:11:55, but Reyes’s first pass (09:11:30–09:11:40) confirms the hallway was clean. Since the spill cannot appear in an empty hallway, it could only have occurred during Lior’s walk, contradicting his statement.
3. Consistent world-model:
   · Basil walks from Door B to Door A (09:10:50–09:10:55) and sees a clean floor.
   · Reyes’s first pass from Door A to Door B (09:11:30–09:11:40) confirms the hallway is still clean.
   · Lior enters at Door A at 09:11:55. Sometime during his 35‑second walk to Door B, the coffee spill occurs (he either causes it or it appears, but he is the only one present). He exits at 09:12:30.
   · Reyes’s second pass from Door B to Door A (09:12:45–09:12:55) finds the fresh spill and reports it.
        Lior’s assertion that the spill predates his entry is false, making him the liar.
