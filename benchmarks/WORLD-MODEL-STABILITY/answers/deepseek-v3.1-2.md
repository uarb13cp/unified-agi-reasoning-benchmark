The spill occurred between 09:11:55 and 09:12:55.
Lior must be lying.

Explanation

· Reyes’s statements are factual: the hallway was clean at the end of his first pass (09:11:40) and had a spill by the start of his second pass (09:12:45).
· A spill cannot appear in an empty hallway. Between 09:11:40 and 09:12:55, the only times someone is inside are:
  · Lior: 09:11:55–09:12:30
  · Reyes (second pass): 09:12:45–09:12:55
· Basil’s walk (09:10:50–09:10:55) was before Reyes’s first pass and clean, so his statement is consistent.
· Lior claims the spill was already there when he entered at 09:11:55. For that to be true, the spill would have had to occur during the empty gap from 09:11:40 to 09:11:55, which is impossible. Therefore Lior’s statement is false—he is lying.
· The spill must have occurred either during Lior’s walk or during Reyes’s second pass. The tightest continuous time window covering both possibilities is from the earliest possible moment (Lior’s entry) to the latest (Reyes’s exit): 09:11:55 to 09:12:55.
