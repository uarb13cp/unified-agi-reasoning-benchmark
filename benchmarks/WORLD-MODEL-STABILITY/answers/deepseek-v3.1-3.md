The coffee spill occurred between 09:11:55 and 09:12:30, while Lior was inside the North Hallway. Lior must be lying because he claims the spill was already present when he entered, but Reyes’s first pass (09:11:30–09:11:40) confirms the hallway was clean, and the spill cannot appear in an empty hallway. The only occupancy between Reyes’s first clean observation and his second sighting of the spill is Lior’s walk, so the spill happened during that time, contradicting Lior’s statement.

Consistent World‑Model

· Basil walks from B to A (09:10:50–09:10:55) and sees a clean floor. This aligns with Reyes’s later clean observation.
· Reyes’s first pass (09:11:30–09:11:40) confirms the hallway is still clean.
· Lior enters at A (09:11:55) and walks to B, exiting at 09:12:30. During this interval, the spill occurs. Lior either caused it or witnessed it, but his statement that it was already there at entry is false.
· Reyes’s second pass (09:12:45–09:12:55) discovers the fresh spill, consistent with it having been left during Lior’s walk.

All badge logs are accurate, and Reyes’s factual statements are trusted. The timeline forces the spill into Lior’s occupancy, making him the only person who could be lying.
