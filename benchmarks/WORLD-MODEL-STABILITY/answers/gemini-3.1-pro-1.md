Here is the solution to the Two-Hallway Coffee Spill Mystery, breaking down the logic based on the provided logs and rules.

1. When did the spill occur?
Between 09:11:55 and 09:12:30.

This is the exact duration of Lior’s time in the North Hallway.

2. Who must be lying?
Lior.

Here is why: Rule 5 states that Reyes’s statements are entirely factual. Because Reyes confirms the hallway was completely clean during his first pass (which ended at 09:11:40), and the hallway was empty between Reyes leaving at 09:11:40 and Lior entering at 09:11:55, it is impossible for the spill to have "already been there" when Lior entered.

3. A Consistent World-Model (How it all fits together)
By anchoring our timeline to the unquestionable facts (the badge logs and Reyes's statements), a single sequence of events emerges:

09:10:50 – 09:10:55 (Basil's Pass): Basil walks through the hallway. As he stated, the floor is clean, and he doesn't spill anything.

09:11:30 – 09:11:40 (Reyes's First Pass): Security Guard Reyes walks through the hallway. As a matter of established fact (Rule 5), the hallway is completely clean during this time. This proves Basil was telling the truth.

09:11:40 – 09:11:55 (Empty Hallway): The hallway is empty. According to Rule 2, a spill cannot appear in an empty hallway. The floor remains clean.

09:11:55 – 09:12:30 (Lior's Pass & The Spill): Lior enters a completely clean hallway. Since Reyes later finds a spill, and a spill requires a person to be present, the spill must have happened during this window. Because Lior is the only person in the hallway, Lior must have caused the spill. Therefore, Lior's statement ("The spill was already there when I entered. I did not cause it.") is a lie designed to avoid the blame.

09:12:45 – 09:12:55 (Reyes's Second Pass): Reyes re-enters the hallway, spots the fresh coffee spill left by Lior, and accurately reports it.
