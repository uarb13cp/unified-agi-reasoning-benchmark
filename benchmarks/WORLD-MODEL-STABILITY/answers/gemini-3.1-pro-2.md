Here is the breakdown of the mystery based on the rules, logs, and statements provided.

1. When did the spill occur?
Between 09:11:55 and 09:12:30. This is the tightest possible time window because it perfectly aligns with the exact duration Lior was inside the hallway.

2. Who must be lying?
Lior. Lior states that the spill was "already there" when he entered at 09:11:55. Based on the established facts, this is physically impossible.

3. How the logs and statements fit together
Here is the step-by-step logical world-model that reconciles the events:

The Baseline (09:10:50 – 09:11:40): Basil walks through the hallway and reports it clean. Shortly after, Security Guard Reyes walks through (09:11:30 – 09:11:40). Because Rule 5 dictates Reyes's reports are factual, we know with absolute certainty that the hallway was completely clean as of 09:11:40 when Reyes badged out.

The Empty Hallway (09:11:40 – 09:11:55): For these 15 seconds, the hallway is entirely empty. According to Rule 2, a spill cannot appear in an empty hallway. Therefore, the floor was still perfectly clean at 09:11:55.

The Incident (09:11:55 – 09:12:30): Lior badges in at 09:11:55. Because we know the hallway was clean at this exact moment, Lior's statement ("The spill was already there when I entered") is a lie. Lior is the only person in the hallway between Reyes's clean inspection and Reyes's discovery of the spill. Therefore, the spill happened while Lior was in the hallway.

The Discovery (09:12:45 – 09:12:55): Reyes enters for a second pass and correctly spots the fresh spill that Lior left behind, reporting it as required.

Ultimately, Basil and Reyes are telling the truth, and Lior is lying to cover up dropping their coffee!
