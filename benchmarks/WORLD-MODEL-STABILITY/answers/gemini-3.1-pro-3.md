Here is the solution to the coffee spill mystery based strictly on the provided logs, rules, and statements.

1. When did the spill occur?
Between 09:11:55 and 09:12:30. ### 2. Who must be lying?
Lior.

3. A Consistent World-Model
To understand how the logs and statements fit together, we must anchor our timeline on two immutable rules provided in the prompt:

Rule 5: Reyes’s statements about the hallway conditions are factual.

Rule 2: A spill cannot appear in an empty hallway.

Here is the step-by-step timeline that proves Lior is the culprit:

Time Window	Occupant	Hallway State / Action	Deduction
09:10:50 – 09:10:55	Basil	Clean	Basil is in the hallway. He leaves it clean.
09:11:30 – 09:11:40	Reyes	Confirmed Clean	Reyes performs his first pass. Because Rule 5 states his reports are factual, we know with 100% certainty the hallway was completely clean when he badged out at 09:11:40.
09:11:40 – 09:11:55	(Empty)	Clean	No one is in the hallway. Because a spill cannot appear in an empty hallway (Rule 2), the floor must still be clean at 09:11:55.
09:11:55 – 09:12:30	Lior	Spill Occurs	Lior enters at 09:11:55. Since the hallway was completely empty prior to this moment, it is physically impossible for the spill to have been there before he entered. The spill must have happened during his transit.
09:12:45 – 09:12:55	Reyes	Spill Discovered	Reyes performs his second pass and factually reports the spill.
Why Lior is lying: Because the hallway was empty between Reyes leaving (09:11:40) and Lior entering (09:11:55), no one could have caused the spill during that 15-second gap. Lior's claim that "The spill was already there when I entered" directly contradicts the established facts of the environment. He is lying to cover up that he spilled the coffee during his 35-second transit.
