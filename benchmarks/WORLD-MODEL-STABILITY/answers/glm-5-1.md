Based on the evidence provided and the logical constraints, here is the solution to the mystery.

### 1. When did the spill occur?
**Time Window: 09:11:55 to 09:12:30**

This is the tightest possible window. The spill occurred while Lior was inside the hallway.

### 2. Who must be lying?
**Lior is definitely lying.**

### 3. Explanation of the Consistent World-Model

Here is how the badge logs and statements fit together to prove Lior's guilt:

**Step 1: Establish the "Clean" Baseline**
*   **Reyes's First Pass (09:11:30 – 09:11:40):** According to Rule 5, Reyes’s statements are factual. He stated the hallway was "completely clean" during this time.
*   **The Empty Gap (09:11:40 – 09:11:55):** The hallway was empty (no badge activity). According to Rule 2, a spill cannot appear in an empty hallway. Therefore, the hallway remained clean during this gap.

**Step 2: Analyze Lior’s Entry**
*   Lior enters at **09:11:55**.
*   Based on the logic in Step 1, the hallway **must have been clean** at the exact moment Lior entered. If the hallway was clean at 09:11:40 and no one was inside to spill anything before 09:11:55, the spill simply could not exist yet.

**Step 3: Identify the Contradiction**
*   **Lior's Statement:** Lior claims, *"The spill was already there when I entered."*
*   **The Reality:** As proven in Step 2, the hallway was clean when he entered. Therefore, Lior is lying about the spill being pre-existing.

**Step 4: Isolate the Spill Event**
*   Since the hallway was clean when Lior entered (09:11:55) and contained a spill when Reyes arrived for his second pass (09:12:45), the spill must have occurred in the interim.
*   **The Empty Gap (09:12:30 – 09:12:45):** Lior exits at 09:12:30. The hallway is then empty until Reyes enters at 09:12:45. By Rule 2, the spill could not appear during this empty interval.
*   **Conclusion:** The spill had to occur while someone was inside the hallway. The only person inside between the "Clean" state (Reyes's first pass/Lior's entry) and the "Spill" state (Reyes's second pass) was Lior.

**Step 5: Verify Other Statements**
*   **Basil (09:10:50 – 09:10:55):** Basil was the first person in the hallway. He claims the floor was clean. This is consistent with Reyes's first pass occurring later and finding the floor clean. Basil is telling the truth.
*   **Reyes:** His statements are treated as factual per the rules. He saw a clean hallway (pass 1) and later a fresh spill (pass 2). This timeline is perfectly consistent with the badge logs.

**Final Verdict:**
Lior spilled the coffee during his walk (between 09:11:55 and 09:12:30). He lied about the spill being there when he entered to shift the blame onto a phantom previous visitor.
