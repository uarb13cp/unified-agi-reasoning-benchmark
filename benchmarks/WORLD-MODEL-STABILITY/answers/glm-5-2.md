Based on the logical deduction from the badge logs and statements, here is the solution:

### 1. When did the spill occur?
The spill occurred between **09:11:55 and 09:12:30**.

This is the tightest possible time window. The hallway was verified as clean immediately before 09:11:55, and the spill was verified as present immediately after 09:12:30. Due to the rule that a spill cannot appear in an empty hallway, the spill must have occurred while Lior was the only person inside.

### 2. Who must be lying?
**Lior** must be lying.

### 3. Explanation of the World-Model
Here is how the badge logs and statements fit together to prove Lior's guilt:

1.  **The Clean Baseline (09:11:30 – 09:11:40):**
    Security Guard Reyes enters the hallway and confirms it is "completely clean." Under Rule #5, this is a factual observation. Therefore, no spill existed prior to 09:11:40.

2.  **The Impossible Appearance (09:11:40 – 09:11:55):**
    Reyes exits at 09:11:40. Lior does not enter until 09:11:55. This 15-second gap is a period where the hallway is empty. Under Rule #2 ("A spill cannot appear in an empty hallway"), it is impossible for the spill to have occurred during this time.

3.  **The Contradiction (09:11:55):**
    Lior enters at 09:11:55. He claims, "The spill was already there when I entered." This is a lie. Because the hallway was verified clean at 09:11:40 and was empty until 09:11:55, the floor *must* have been clean the moment Lior walked in.

4.  **The Closed Window (09:11:55 – 09:12:30):**
    Lior is the only person in the hallway during this time. Since the hallway was clean when he entered, and a spill cannot appear in an empty hallway, the spill must occur while he is inside. He is the only person who could have caused it.

5.  **The Verification (09:12:30 – 09:12:45):**
    Lior exits at 09:12:30. The hallway is empty for 15 seconds. The spill does not "appear" here; it simply persists from Lior's occupancy.

6.  **The Discovery (09:12:45):**
    Reyes re-enters at 09:12:45 and finds a "fresh coffee spill." This confirms the spill occurred during the previous occupancy. Lior's statement that he "did not cause it" is a lie to cover up the fact that he spilled the coffee during his walk.
