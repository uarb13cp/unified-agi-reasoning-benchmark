**1. The spill occurred between 09:11:55 and 09:12:30.**  
(This is the tightest window possible in the consistent scenario; it is the exact period Lior was alone inside after the last confirmed-clean check.)

**2. Lior must be lying.**  
(Basil and Reyes can both be truthful; Reyes’s hallway-condition statements are explicitly factual per the rules.)

**3. Here is the single consistent world-model that satisfies every rule, log entry, and statement (with only the necessary lie):**  

- **Basil (09:10:50 IN B → 09:10:55 OUT A, B-to-A)**: Hallway empty before him and still empty after. Spill has not happened yet, so floor is clean. He sees nothing, spills nothing. His “around 09:11” is reasonable for 09:10:55 (5 s before the minute). Statement true.  

- **Reyes first pass (09:11:30 IN A → 09:11:40 OUT B, A-to-B)**: Treated as factual — hallway completely clean. No spill present or created during/prior to this pass.  

- **Empty 09:11:40–09:11:55 (15 s)**: No one inside → spill cannot appear here (Rule 2).  

- **Lior (09:11:55 IN A → 09:12:30 OUT B, A-to-B)**: Enters a clean hallway (post-Reyes clean + empty gap). At some point during his 35-second walk he spills coffee in the middle. He then exits, leaving the spill. His statement (“spill was already there when I entered … I did not cause it”) is false on both counts — this is the required lie (he is covering his guilt). “Around 09:12” matches his actual window perfectly.  

- **Empty 09:12:30–09:12:45 (15 s)**: Spill already exists; it does not “appear” now (Rule 2 satisfied).  

- **Reyes second pass (09:12:45 IN B → 09:12:55 OUT A, B-to-A)**: Enters, walks the hallway, sees the fresh spill (at most ~50 s old, still visibly wet) in the middle, and reports it exactly as stated. Conditions factual per Rule 5; phrasing “I saw … and reported it” fits a guard discovering an incident on routine duty.  

All badge logs are accurate and exhaustive (no other events). Spill appears only while someone is inside (Lior). Reyes’s observations are treated as factual and never contradicted. No one else needs to lie. Basil passed too early to have caused it; Reyes’s first pass was verifiably clean. This produces exactly one spill, reported exactly when and how Reyes describes.  

(The alternative “Reyes spilled it himself on pass 2” is technically possible on raw timestamps but breaks natural consistency: it requires an innocent Lior to lie with no motive, and a security guard on routine duty to accidentally spill coffee, then phrase the report as a discovery. The model above needs only the guilty party to lie, which is the standard, motive-driven solution for this class of puzzle.)
