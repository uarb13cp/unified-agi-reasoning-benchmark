**1. The spill occurred between 09:11:55 and 09:12:30.**

**2. Lior must be lying.**

**3. Here is the one consistent world-model that satisfies every rule, log, and statement (with Reyes’s hallway-condition observations treated as factual per rule 5, and the spill appearing only while the hallway is occupied per rule 2):**

- Basil enters at B (09:10:50) and exits at A (09:10:55). He walks B→A on a clean floor (as he states and as later confirmed by Reyes’s first pass), sees no spill, and spills nothing. His statement is entirely true.

- Hallway empty 09:10:55–09:11:30 and 09:11:40–09:11:55 (no badge events = no one inside).

- Reyes’s **first** pass: enters A (09:11:30) → exits B (09:11:40). He truthfully reports the hallway completely clean. Spill cannot have happened yet.

- Hallway empty 09:11:40–09:11:55 → spill **cannot** have appeared (rule 2). Therefore, when Lior badges IN at A (09:11:55), the hallway is still clean.

- Lior is inside alone 09:11:55–09:12:30 (A→B). **During this interval he spills the coffee** (only person present, so he is the one who causes it). The spill is now in the middle of the hallway.

- Lior’s full statement (“The spill was already there when I entered. I did not cause it.”) is false on both clauses: it was *not* already there (impossible per above), and he *did* cause it. This is the required lie; everything else in the model is consistent.

- Hallway empty again 09:12:30–09:12:45 (spill sits there, undisturbed).

- Reyes’s **second** pass: enters B (09:12:45) → exits A (09:12:55). He truthfully sees the fresh coffee spill (only 15–60 seconds old at most; still visibly “fresh”/wet) in the middle and reports it exactly as stated.

- No other badge events occur, so no other person could have created or removed the spill.

This model satisfies every constraint:
- All badge logs are accurate and exhaustive.
- Spill appears only while occupied (by Lior).
- Reyes’s observations of hallway conditions are factual.
- Basil’s statement is true; Lior’s is false (he is covering up); Reyes’s is true.
- The same spill is found and reported.

No other configuration works without violating a rule or a factual statement. The two empty periods rule out any earlier spill, and Lior’s entry-time claim is impossible, forcing Lior to be the liar and the spiller. The short empty gap after Lior leaves keeps the spill “fresh” when Reyes passes seconds later.
