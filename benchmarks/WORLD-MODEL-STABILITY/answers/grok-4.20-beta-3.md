**1. The spill occurred between 09:11:55 and 09:12:30.**

**2. Lior must be lying.**

**3.** The badge logs are accurate and show four separate solo transits with no overlaps or unlogged entries (per the “no other badge events” rule and the requirement to badge in/out to pass through):

- Basil (B→A): alone 09:10:50–09:10:55.  
- Reyes #1 (A→B): alone 09:11:30–09:11:40.  
- Lior (A→B): alone 09:11:55–09:12:30.  
- Reyes #2 (B→A): alone 09:12:45–09:12:55.

Rule 5 makes Reyes’s observations factual: the hallway was **completely clean** throughout his first pass (so the spill was not present at or before 09:11:40), and he saw a **fresh coffee spill** during his second pass (so the spill was present by 09:12:45–09:12:55).  

Rule 2 requires that the spill could only *appear* (i.e., be caused) while the hallway was occupied. The only occupied interval after the last clean sighting (09:11:40) and before the first dirty sighting (09:12:45+) is Lior’s solo walk. The 15-second empties (11:40–11:55 and 12:30–12:45) cannot produce a spill. Therefore the spill was caused by Lior while he was inside (09:11:55–09:12:30). He then exited at 09:12:30, leaving the spill behind; the hallway sat empty for 15 seconds; Reyes #2 entered, saw the fresh spill (still fresh after <1 minute), and reported it.

This produces one fully consistent world-model:

- Basil’s walk was long before the spill → floor was clean and he did not spill → his entire statement is true.  
- Reyes #1 saw clean (factual). Reyes #2 discovered and reported the spill (factual).  
- Lior entered a clean hallway, spilled the coffee himself sometime during his 35-second A→B walk, then lied: “The spill was already there when I entered” (false—impossible after an empty interval) and “I did not cause it” (false—he did). His motive is obvious: to deflect blame.

No other timing or culprit works without violating Reyes’s factual observations, the “cannot appear in empty hallway” rule, or the requirement for a single coherent timeline. Basil and Reyes are truthful; only Lior’s statement is false. The logs, rules, and statements now align perfectly.
