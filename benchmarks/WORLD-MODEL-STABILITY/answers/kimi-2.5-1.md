I'll analyze this step-by-step, tracking who is in the hallway when and cross-referencing with the statements.

Timeline of Occupancy

Let me map out when each person was in the hallway:

Time	Event	Who's Inside	
09:10:50	Basil IN (Door B)	Basil	
09:10:55	Basil OUT (Door A)	empty	
09:11:30	Reyes IN (Door A)	Reyes	
09:11:40	Reyes OUT (Door B)	empty	
09:11:55	Lior IN (Door A)	Lior	
09:12:30	Lior OUT (Door B)	empty	
09:12:45	Reyes IN (Door B)	Reyes	
09:12:55	Reyes OUT (Door A)	empty	

Analyzing the Statements

Reyes's statement (treated as factual per Rule 5):
- First pass (09:11:30–09:11:40): Hallway was clean
- Second pass (09:12:45–09:12:55): Spill was fresh and present

This means the spill appeared between 09:11:40 and 09:12:45.

Basil's statement:
- Walked through 09:10:50–09:10:55
- Claims floor was clean

This is consistent with Reyes's report (spill happened after 09:11:40). Basil is telling the truth.

Lior's statement:
- Walked through 09:11:55–09:12:30
- Claims spill was already there when I entered

But Reyes confirmed the hallway was clean at 09:11:40, and Lior entered at 09:11:55. The spill couldn't have appeared between 09:11:40 and 09:11:55 because the hallway was empty during that time (Rule 2: spill cannot appear in empty hallway).

Therefore, Lior is lying. The spill was NOT there when Lior entered.

When Did the Spill Actually Occur?

Since:
- Reyes found it fresh at 09:12:45
- The hallway was empty 09:12:30–09:12:45
- Lior was inside 09:11:55–09:12:30

The spill must have occurred while Lior was in the hallway: between 09:11:55 and 09:12:30.

Lior caused the spill (accidentally or intentionally) and lied about it being there upon entry.

Answers

1. When did the spill occur?

> 09:11:55 to 09:12:30 — while Lior was in the hallway.

2. Who must be lying?

> Lior — The spill could not have been present when Lior entered (hallway was empty and clean just before, per Reyes's factual statement). Lior caused it while walking through and falsely claimed it was already there.

3. Consistent world-model:

Time	Event	Hallway State	
09:10:50–09:10:55	Basil crosses B→A	Clean ✓	
09:11:30–09:11:40	Reyes crosses A→B, verifies clean	Clean ✓	
09:11:55–09:12:30	Lior crosses A→B, spills coffee	Spill occurs	
09:12:45–09:12:55	Reyes crosses B→B, finds fresh spill	Spill present ✓	

Lior lied to avoid responsibility. Reyes and Basil told the truth.
