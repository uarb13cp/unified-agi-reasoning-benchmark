I'll solve this step-by-step, analyzing the timeline and checking consistency.

Timeline Analysis

Time	Event	Person in Hallway	
09:10:50	Basil IN (Door B)	Basil	
09:10:55	Basil OUT (Door A)	empty	
09:11:30	Reyes IN (Door A)	Reyes	
09:11:40	Reyes OUT (Door B)	empty	
09:11:55	Lior IN (Door A)	Lior	
09:12:30	Lior OUT (Door B)	empty	
09:12:45	Reyes IN (Door B)	Reyes	
09:12:55	Reyes OUT (Door A)	empty	

Key Constraints from Statements

Reyes's statements are FACTUAL (Rule 5):
- 09:11:30–09:11:40: Hallway was clean
- 09:12:45–09:12:55: Spill was present and fresh

This means the spill occurred between 09:11:40 and 09:12:45.

Checking Who Was Present

Between 09:11:40 and 09:12:45, the hallway was empty:
- Reyes left at 09:11:40
- Lior entered at 09:11:55
- Lior left at 09:12:30
- Reyes entered at 09:12:45

Wait—let me recheck: Lior was in the hallway from 09:11:55 to 09:12:30, which falls within 09:11:40–09:12:45.

So Lior was present when the spill could have occurred.

Evaluating Statements

Basil: Claims floor was clean at 09:10:50–09:10:55. ✅ Consistent — this is before Reyes's first pass, and before the spill window.

Reyes: Clean at 09:11:30–09:11:40, spill present at 09:12:45–09:12:55. ✅ Consistent and factual — defines the spill window as (09:11:40, 09:12:45).

Lior: Claims "spill was already there when I entered" at 09:11:55. ❌ INCONSISTENT — The spill cannot have been there at 09:11:55 because:
- Reyes confirmed the hallway was clean at 09:11:40
- The spill must have appeared between 09:11:40 and 09:12:45
- Lior entered at 09:11:55, which is after 09:11:40

If Lior entered at 09:11:55 and the spill wasn't there at 09:11:40, the spill appeared while Lior was in the hallway or after Lior left. It was definitely NOT "already there when I entered."

Answers

1. When did the spill occur?

Tightest window: 09:11:40 to 09:12:30

The spill appeared after Reyes left (09:11:40) and before Lior left (09:12:30), because:
- Lior was the only person in the hallway during this entire period (09:11:55–09:12:30)
- The spill was fresh when Reyes returned at 09:12:45

More precisely: between 09:11:55 and 09:12:30 (while Lior was inside), since no one else entered during this window.

2. Who must be lying?

Lior is lying.

Lior falsely claims the spill "was already there when I entered." But Reyes's factual testimony confirms the hallway was clean just 15 seconds before Lior entered. The spill appeared while Lior was inside, making Lior the only possible culprit.

3. Consistent World-Model

- 09:10:50–09:10:55: Basil crosses, floor is clean.
- 09:11:30–09:11:40: Reyes crosses first time, confirms clean.
- 09:11:55: Lior enters a clean hallway.
- 09:11:55–09:12:30: Lior spills coffee while walking through.
- 09:12:30: Lior exits, leaving the spill.
- 09:12:45–09:12:55: Reyes crosses second time, discovers fresh spill and reports it.

Lior lied to deflect blame, falsely claiming the spill predated his arrival. Since Reyes's security reporting is factual, and the badge logs are accurate, Lior's statement is the only inconsistency—and it reveals Lior as the spiller.
