I'll analyze this step-by-step, tracking who is in the hallway when and cross-referencing with the statements.

Timeline Analysis

Time	Event	People in Hallway	
09:10:50	Basil IN (Door B)	Basil	
09:10:55	Basil OUT (Door A)	empty	
09:11:30	Reyes IN (Door A)	Reyes	
09:11:40	Reyes OUT (Door B)	empty	
09:11:55	Lior IN (Door A)	Lior	
09:12:30	Lior OUT (Door B)	empty	
09:12:45	Reyes IN (Door B)	Reyes	
09:12:55	Reyes OUT (Door A)	empty	

Cross-Referencing Statements

Reyes's statements are factual (Rule 5):
- First pass (09:11:30–09:11:40): Hallway clean
- Second pass (09:12:45–09:12:55): Fresh spill present

This means the spill appeared after 09:11:40 and before 09:12:45.

Checking Basil (09:10:50–09:10:55):
- Claims floor was clean ✓ (Consistent with Reyes's first pass being clean later)

Checking Lior (09:11:55–09:12:30):
- Claims spill was "already there when I entered" at 09:11:55
- But Reyes confirmed the hallway was clean at 09:11:40, just 15 seconds before Lior entered
- The spill must have appeared after 09:11:40 and before 09:12:45

The Critical Window

The hallway was empty from 09:11:40 to 09:11:55. Then only Lior was present from 09:11:55 to 09:12:30.

Since:
- The spill cannot appear in an empty hallway (Rule 2)
- Reyes found it fresh at 09:12:45
- Lior was the only person in the hallway between 09:11:40 and 09:12:45

Lior must have caused the spill during 09:11:55–09:12:30.

Answers

1. When did the spill occur?
Tightest window: between 09:11:55 and 09:12:30 (while Lior was alone in the hallway)

2. Who must be lying?
Lior is lying. 

Lior claims "the spill was already there when I entered" — but Reyes confirmed the hallway was clean at 09:11:40, and no one else entered between then and Lior's entry at 09:11:55. The spill couldn't have appeared in the empty hallway, so Lior's claim is impossible.

3. Consistent World-Model

- 09:10:50–09:10:55: Basil crosses, floor is clean ✓
- 09:11:30–09:11:40: Reyes crosses first time, confirms clean ✓
- 09:11:55–09:12:30: Lior enters alone, spills coffee, then lies about it being there already
- 09:12:45–09:12:55: Reyes crosses second time, discovers fresh spill and reports it ✓

Reality: Lior accidentally spilled coffee while crossing the hallway, then lied to avoid blame. The "fresh" appearance when Reyes saw it at 09:12:45 fits perfectly with Lior having just spilled it minutes earlier during 09:11:55–09:12:30.
