Cross-Referencing Statements with Factual ConstraintsConstraint: Reyes's Statements are Factual•Reyes (09:11:30–09:11:40): Hallway was clean.•Implication: The spill did not exist before 09:11:40.•Reyes (09:12:45–09:12:55): Saw a fresh spill.•Implication: The spill must have occurred between 09:11:40 and 09:12:45.Constraint: A spill cannot appear in an empty hallway•Empty Periods between 09:11:40 and 09:12:45:•09:11:40 - 09:11:55 (Empty)•09:12:30 - 09:12:45 (Empty)•Occupied Periods between 09:11:40 and 09:12:45:•09:11:55 - 09:12:30 (Occupied by Lior)Conclusion on TimingThe spill must have occurred during an occupied period. Since it wasn't there when Reyes left at 09:11:40 and was there when Reyes returned at 09:12:45, and the only person in the hallway during that window was Lior, the spill must have occurred between 09:11:55 and 09:12:30.3. Evaluating Statements for Lies•Basil: Claims the floor was clean during his pass (09:10:50-09:10:55). This is consistent with Reyes's report that it was clean later at 09:11:30. Basil is likely telling the truth.•Reyes: Statements are treated as factual per Rule 5.•Lior: Claims the spill was "already there when I entered" (at 09:11:55).•Contradiction: If the spill was there at 09:11:55, it must have occurred during or before the previous occupied period (Reyes's first pass 09:11:30-09:11:40).•Fact: Reyes (whose statements are factual) says the hallway was "completely clean" during that pass.•Fact: The hallway was empty between Reyes's exit (09:11:40) and Lior's entry (09:11:55).•Conclusion: Since the hallway was clean at 09:11:40 and empty until 09:11:55, the spill could not have been there when Lior entered. Therefore, Lior must be lying.
