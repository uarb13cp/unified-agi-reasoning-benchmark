I have completed the investigation of the Two-Hallway Coffee Spill Mystery. Based on the badge logs, the provided rules, and the statements from the individuals involved, I have determined the exact time window of the spill and identified the individual who must be lying.

### **1. When did the spill occur?**
The spill occurred between **09:11:55 and 09:12:30**.

### **2. Who must be lying?**
**Lior** is definitely lying.

### **3. Consistency Analysis and World-Model**

To reconstruct the events, we must first establish the occupancy of the North Hallway based on the badge logs and the factual reporting of Security Guard Reyes (Rule 5).

| Time Window | Occupant(s) | Hallway Condition | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 09:10:50 – 09:10:55 | Basil | Clean | Basil claims it was clean; Reyes confirms it was clean later. |
| 09:10:55 – 09:11:30 | **None** | Clean | Rule 2: No spill can occur in an empty hallway. |
| 09:11:30 – 09:11:40 | Reyes | **Clean** | **Fact (Rule 5):** Reyes confirms the floor is clean at 09:11:40. |
| 09:11:40 – 09:11:55 | **None** | Clean | Rule 2: No spill can occur in an empty hallway. |
| 09:11:55 – 09:12:30 | **Lior** | **Spill Occurs** | Only person in the hallway between Reyes's two passes. |
| 09:12:30 – 09:12:45 | **None** | Spilled | Hallway is empty, but the spill has already occurred. |
| 09:12:45 – 09:12:55 | Reyes | **Spilled** | **Fact (Rule 5):** Reyes reports the spill upon entry. |

#### **The Logic of the Contradiction:**
*   **Reyes's first pass (09:11:30–09:11:40):** The hallway is confirmed clean.
*   **The Gap (09:11:40–09:11:55):** The hallway is empty. Per Rule 2, the spill cannot appear during this time.
*   **Lior's Statement:** Lior claims the spill was *already there* when he entered at 09:11:55.
*   **The Conflict:** For Lior's statement to be true, the spill must have appeared between 09:11:40 (when Reyes saw it was clean) and 09:11:55 (when Lior entered). However, the hallway was empty during this entire interval. Rule 2 states a spill cannot appear in an empty hallway.
*   **Conclusion:** Since Reyes's statement is factual (Rule 5) and the badge logs are accurate (Rule 1), the only way to satisfy Rule 2 is if the spill occurred while someone was inside. The only person inside between the "clean" check and the "spill" report was Lior. Therefore, Lior caused the spill and is lying to deflect blame.
