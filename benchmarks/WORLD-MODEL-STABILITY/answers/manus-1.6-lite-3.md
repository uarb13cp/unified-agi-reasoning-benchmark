I did not cause it."•Contradiction: If the spill was there when Lior entered at 09:11:55, it must have occurred during a previous pass.•The previous passes were Reyes (1st) and Basil.•Reyes says it was clean during his 1st pass (09:11:30 - 09:11:40). Rule 5 says Reyes is accurate.•Therefore, the spill could not have happened during Basil's pass (09:10:50 - 09:10:55) because Reyes would have seen it at 09:11:30.•If it didn't happen during Basil's pass, and the hallway was empty between Basil and Reyes, it couldn't have appeared then.•If it wasn't there during Reyes's 1st pass, and the hallway was empty between Reyes (1st) and Lior, it couldn't have appeared then.•Conclusion: The spill must have occurred during Lior's pass (09:11:55 - 09:12:30).•Since Lior claims it was already there when he entered, Lior is lying.Basil•Statement: "I walked... around 09:11. The floor was clean... I didn't see any spill."•Verification: This is consistent with Reyes's observation at 09:11:30. Basil is likely telling the truth.Final Conclusions1. When did the spill occur?The spill occurred between 09:11:55 and 09:12:30.•It could not have happened before 09:11:40 (end of Reyes's first pass) because Reyes reported the hallway as "completely clean" then.•It could not have happened during the empty period (09:11:40 to 09:11:55) because a spill requires someone to be present.•It was discovered at 09:12:45 (start of Reyes's second pass).•The only person in the hallway between these two points was Lior.2. Who must be lying?Lior is definitely lying.
Lior claims the spill was already there at 09:11:55. However, Reyes (whose statement is factual) confirms the hallway was clean until at least 09:11:40. Since the hallway was empty from 09:11:40 to 09:11:55, no spill could have occurred during that interval. Therefore, the spill could only have happened during Lior's occupancy, making his claim that it was already there impossible.3. Consistent World-Model•09:10:50 – 09:10:55: Basil passes through. Hallway is clean.•09:11:30 – 09:11:40: Reyes passes through. Hallway is clean.•09:11:55 – 09:12:30: Lior passes through. The spill occurs during this window.•09:12:45 – 09:12:55: Reyes passes through, sees the spill, and reports it.•Basil and Reyes are telling the truth. Lior is lying to deflect blame for the spill he caused.
