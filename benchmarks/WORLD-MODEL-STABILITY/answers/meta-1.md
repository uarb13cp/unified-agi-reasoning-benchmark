Here's the breakdown of the coffee spill mystery:

1. When did the spill occur?

The spill occurred in the 15-second window between 09:11:40 and 09:11:55.

2. Who must be lying?

Lior must be lying.

3. How does it all fit together?

Here is the consistent timeline of events:

  09:11:30 – 09:11:40: Security Guard Reyes is in the hallway. Per his factual statement, the floor is clean. He exits at 09:11:40, leaving the hallway empty and clean.
  09:11:40 – 09:11:55: The hallway is empty. According to the rules, a spill cannot occur during this time because no one is inside.
  09:11:55: Lior badges IN at Door A. This is the first moment the spill could have happened after Reyes confirmed the floor was clean.
  09:12:30: Lior badges OUT at Door B.
  09:12:45: Reyes badges IN for his second pass and sees the spill.

Based on this, Lior's statement that "The spill was already there when I entered" is impossible. The hallway was confirmed clean by Reyes just 15 seconds before Lior entered, and it was empty during that interval. Therefore, the spill must have happened while Lior was the sole occupant of the hallway, and he is the one being untruthful.
