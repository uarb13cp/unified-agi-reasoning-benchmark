Here's the breakdown of the coffee spill mystery:

When did the spill occur?
    The spill happened between 09:11:40 and 09:11:55. According to Security Guard Reyes (whose statements are fact), the hallway was clean during his first pass, which ended at 09:11:40. Lior states the spill was already present when he entered at 09:11:55. Since a spill cannot appear in an empty hallway, it must have occurred during the 15-second window between Reyes leaving and Lior entering.

Who must be lying?
    No one is definitely lying. The statements and logs can all be true, but only if Lior isn't the one who caused the spill. See the explanation below.

How do the events fit together?
    This puzzle hinges on a contradiction created by two rules: a spill can't appear in an empty hallway, but the hallway was empty during the only time the spill could have occurred (between 09:11:40 and 09:11:55).

    This implies someone created the spill without being logged in the hallway. The only way this works is if the spill originated from outside one of the doors while the hallway was empty. For example, someone could have opened a door and thrown or spilled the coffee into the hallway without badging in and fully entering.

    Here is the consistent timeline:
  09:11:30 – 09:11:40: Reyes passes through the clean hallway.
  09:11:40 – 09:11:55: The hallway is empty. At some point during these 15 seconds, an unknown person opens a door, spills the coffee into the hallway, and leaves without ever badging in.
  09:11:55: Lior badges in and sees the spill, just as he claimed.
  09:12:45: Reyes badges in for his second pass and also sees the spill, just as he claimed.
