Here is the solution to the mystery:

When did the spill occur?
    The spill occurred in the single second between 09:12:45 and 09:12:46.

Who must be lying?
    Lior must be lying.

Explanation:
    Here is the step-by-step breakdown of the events based on the facts provided:

  Reyes's statements are fact. According to Rule #5, we must accept Security Guard Reyes's observations as true.
  This means the hallway was clean when Reyes finished his first pass at 09:11:40.
  This also means the spill existed when Reyes started his second pass at 09:12:45.
  Therefore, the spill must have appeared sometime between 09:11:40 and 09:12:45.

    Now let's analyze the statements:

  Lior's lie: Lior claims the spill was "already there" when he entered at 09:11:55. This directly contradicts the fact that the hallway was clean until at least 09:11:40, and was empty between 09:11:40 and 09:11:55. Since a spill cannot appear in an empty hallway (Rule #2), it could not have been there when Lior entered. He is lying.

  Basil's statement is truthful. He was in the hallway from 09:10:50 to 09:10:55 and said it was clean. This is consistent with all other facts.

  Pinpointing the moment:
  The hallway was empty and clean from 09:11:40 until Lior entered at 09:11:55.
  Lior was the only person in the hallway from 09:11:55 to 09:12:30. He must have caused the spill during this time.
  The hallway was then empty again from 09:12:30 to 09:12:45.
  At 09:12:45, Reyes entered and saw the spill.

    The tightest time window for the spill is between when Lior was last known to be in the hallway (and could have spilled it just before leaving) and when Reyes first saw it. However, the puzzle asks for when the spill occurred. Reyes describes it as a "fresh" spill on his second pass, which starts at 09:12:45. The most logical conclusion is that the spill happened during the time a person was present and before Reyes saw it. This points to Lior's presence. But to create the tightest possible window based on all rules:

The spill could not have happened before 09:11:55 (when Lior entered the clean, empty hall).
The spill must have happened by 09:12:45 (when Reyes entered and saw it).
Since Lior left at 09:12:30, the spill must have happened between 09:11:55 and 09:12:30.

    However, let's re-read the prompt very carefully to find the most precise window.
    Reyes's statement on his second pass is that he "saw a fresh coffee spill". This report is factual. The most extreme interpretation that fits all the rules is that the spill happened the instant he entered. Therefore:
The spill happened after Lior left at 09:12:30.
The spill must happen while someone is inside.
Reyes entered at 09:12:45.
This creates a contradiction unless we re-evaluate Lior's lie. Lior lied about the spill being there. He is the only one who could have made the spill. The spill happened while he was in the hall: between 09:11:55 and 09:12:30. Reyes saw it at 09:12:45. This is the most straightforward reading.

    Let's re-examine the prompt for any tricks. "...second pass (09:12:45–09:12:55), I saw a fresh coffee spill and reported it." This implies the discovery, not the occurrence. The only person present to make the spill between Reyes's two patrols was Lior.

    Therefore, the final, simplest model is:
09:11:40: Hallway is confirmed clean and empty.
09:11:55 - 09:12:30: Lior is in the hallway and spills the coffee. He lies about it.
09:12:45: Reyes enters and discovers the spill Lior left behind.
