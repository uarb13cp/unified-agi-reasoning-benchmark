I'll analyze this logic puzzle systematically to determine the spill timing, identify the liar, and reconstruct the consistent world model.

Analysis
Let me first establish the timeline of who's in the hallway at each moment:

Individual occupancy periods:

Basil: 09:10:50 - 09:10:55 (5 seconds)
Reyes (first pass): 09:11:30 - 09:11:40 (10 seconds)
Lior: 09:11:55 - 09:12:30 (35 seconds)
Reyes (second pass): 09:12:45 - 09:12:55 (10 seconds)
Overlapping occupancy windows:

09:11:40-09:11:55: Lior and Reyes overlap for 15 seconds (this is the KEY window)
09:12:30-09:12:45: Lior and Reyes overlap for 15 seconds
Now let me apply the key constraints:

1.
Reyes's first pass was clean: This means no spill existed during 09:11:30-09:11:40
2.
Reyes saw the spill on his second pass: The spill existed by 09:12:45
3.
Lior saw the spill when entering: The spill existed by 09:11:55
Since the spill exists by 09:11:55 (when Lior enters) AND did NOT exist during 09:11:30-09:11:40 (Reyes's first pass), the spill must have occurred during the 15-second window when Lior and Reyes were both in the hallway: 09:11:40 to 09:11:55.

This is the tightest possible time window.

Answers
1. When did the spill occur?
The spill occurred between 09:11:40 and 09:11:55 — the 15-second window when both Lior and Reyes were in the hallway simultaneously. This is the only time period where:

A spill could form (hallway not empty)
After Reyes's first pass confirmed cleanliness
Before Lior's reported entry time
2. Who must be lying?
Lior is lying.

3. How the statements and logs fit together:

The consistent reconstruction is:

09:11:40-09:11:55: During the 15-second overlap between Reyes (leaving via Door B) and Lior (entering via Door A), the coffee spill occurs. Given that Reyes is a trained security guard making routine observations (Rule 5), his factual accuracy is guaranteed — he would not miss observing a spill on his first pass, and he would accurately report seeing one on his second pass.
Lior's lie: Lior claims the spill was "already there when I entered" at 09:11:55, but the spill actually occurred during the 09:11:40-09:11:55 window while both he and Reyes were present. Since Lior was in the hallway when the spill happened (and no one else was), Lior must have caused it — yet he denies this and claims it was already present, making his statement false.
Reyes is truthful: His statements are fully consistent with the timeline and are guaranteed accurate by Rule 5.
Basil is truthful: He was in and out before 09:11, never encountered a spill, and made no false claims.
This creates one fully consistent world-model where badge logs are accurate, the spill occurs in a non-empty hallway, and all statements align except Lior's deception about the spill's origin.
