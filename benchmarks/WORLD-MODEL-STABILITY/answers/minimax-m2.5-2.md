I'll analyze this logic puzzle systematically to solve the coffee spill mystery.

Timeline Analysis
Let me map out exactly who was in the hallway and when:

Occupancy Timeline:

09:10:50 - 09:10:55: Basil (5 seconds, walking B→A)
09:11:30 - 09:11:40: Reyes - First pass (10 seconds, A→B)
09:11:55 - 09:12:30: Lior (35 seconds, A→B)
09:12:45 - 09:12:55: Reyes - Second pass (10 seconds, B→A)
Key Observations:

1.
Basil's window is too early: He was in the hallway at 09:10:50-09:10:55, but Reyes's first pass (09:11:30-09:11:40) confirmed the hallway was completely clean.
2.
The spill must occur during Lior's presence: Since the hallway was clean during Reyes's first pass (09:11:40) and Reyes saw a "fresh coffee spill" during his second pass (09:12:45-09:12:55), the spill must have occurred while Lior was in the hallway (between 09:11:55 and 09:12:30).
3.
Lior's statement contradicts the facts: Lior claims "The spill was already there when I entered" (at 09:11:55), but Reyes explicitly stated the hallway was clean during his first pass (09:11:30-09:11:40), which ended before Lior entered. The spill could not have been there when Lior entered.
Answers to the Questions
1. When did the spill occur? Give the tightest possible time window.
The spill occurred between 09:11:55 and 09:12:30 (the exact moment Lior was in the hallway). Since we know it wasn't there when Reyes left at 09:11:40, and it was there when Reyes returned at 09:12:45, the tightest window is during Lior's presence: 09:11:55 - 09:12:30.

More precisely, it must have occurred sometime after 09:11:55 (when Lior entered) and before 09:12:30 (when Lior exited).

2. Who must be lying?
Lior must be lying. Here's why:

Reyes's statements are factual (per Rule 5: his observations about hallway conditions are accurate)
Reyes confirmed the hallway was clean during his first pass (09:11:30-09:11:40)
Lior entered at 09:11:55, after Reyes's first pass confirmed cleanliness
Therefore, the spill could not have been there when Lior entered
Lior's claim that "the spill was already there when I entered" is contradicted by Reyes's verified observation
3. How the badge logs and statements fit together into one consistent world-model
The consistent model is:

1.
Basil walks through hallway B→A at 09:10:50-09:10:55. Floor is clean. His statement is true.
2.
Reyes (first pass) walks A→B at 09:11:30-09:11:40. He confirms the hallway is completely clean. His statement is true.
3.
Lior enters at 09:11:55. At this point, the hallway has been confirmed clean by Reyes just 15 seconds earlier. The spill has NOT occurred yet.
4.
While Lior is in the hallway (09:11:55-09:12:30), either:
Lior accidentally spills the coffee, OR
Some other mechanism causes the spill (but logically, Lior is the only one present)
5.
Lior exits at 09:12:30. The spill is now present in the hallway.
6.
Reyes returns (second pass) at 09:12:45-09:12:55 and sees a fresh coffee spill. He reports it. His statement is true.
7.
Lior's claim that "the spill was already there when I entered" is false - a lie, likely to avoid responsibility.
Summary
Person	Statement	Truth Value
Basil	"Floor was clean, didn't see spill"	✅ TRUE
Lior	"Spill was already there when I entered"	❌ FALSE (lying)
Reyes	"First pass: clean. Second pass: fresh spill"	✅ TRUE (factual)
Conclusion: Lior is the coffee spiller, and lied about it. The spill occurred during Lior's presence in the hallway (09:11:55-09:12:30), with the tightest window being when Lior was the sole occupant.
