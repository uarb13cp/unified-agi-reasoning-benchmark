1. The spill occurred at 09:11:55.
2. Lior is lying.
3. The badge logs and statements fit together as follows:
   - Basil was in the hallway from 09:10:50 to 09:10:55 and saw no spill (consistent with the logs and his statement).
   - Reyes' first pass from 09:11:30 to 09:11:40 confirmed the hallway was clean.
   - Lior entered at 09:11:55 and must have caused the spill at that moment, contradicting his statement that he did not cause it.
   - Reyes' second pass from 09:12:45 to 09:12:55 confirmed the presence of the spill.

Thus, the only consistent explanation is that the spill occurred at 09:11:55 and Lior is lying about not causing it.

To summarize:

1. The spill occurred at 09:11:55.
2. Lior must be lying about not causing the spill.
3. The sequence of events is consistent with the badge logs and statements, except for Lior's false claim about not causing the spill.
