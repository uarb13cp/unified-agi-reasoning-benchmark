1. The spill occurred between 09:11:55 and 09:12:30.
2. Lior must be lying.
3. Explanation:
   - Basil passed through the hallway from 09:10:50 to 09:10:55 and found it clean.
   - Reyes passed through the hallway from 09:11:30 to 09:11:40 and confirmed it was clean.
   - Lior entered the hallway at 09:11:55. The hallway was clean when he entered, but he caused the spill during his time in the hallway (by 09:12:30) and lied about the spill being there when he entered.
   - Reyes saw the spill during his second pass from 09:12:45 to 09:12:55.

Thus, the spill occurred during Lior's time in the hallway, and Lior is lying about the spill being there when he entered.

This fits all the given information and rules.
