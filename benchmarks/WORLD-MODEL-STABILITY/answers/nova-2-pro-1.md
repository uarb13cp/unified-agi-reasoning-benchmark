### 1. When did the spill occur?

 The spill occurred between **09:11:40** and **09:12:30**.

 This is because:
 - Reyes’s first pass (09:11:30–09:11:40) found the hallway clean.- Lior entered at 09:11:55 and claims the spill was already there.- Lior exited at 09:12:30.So the spill must have appeared **after** Reyes left at 09:11:40 and **before** Lior entered at 09:11:55.** However,** since Lior claims it was already there when he entered, the latest it could have appeared is just before he entered at 09:11:55.

 **Tightest window: 09:11:40 – 09:11:55.** 

### 2. Who must be lying?

 **Basil** must be lying.

 - Basil claims he walked from Door B to Door A around 09:11 and the floor was clean.- However, the spill occurred between 09:11:40 and 09:11:55, which is **within** Basil’s walk time (09:10:50–09:10:55).This makes it impossible for the floor to have been clean when he walked, contradicting his statement.

 ### 3. Consistent world-model explanation

 1. **Basil** enters at 09:10:50 (Door B) and exits at 09:10:55 (Door A). During this time, the hallway must have been empty before he entered and then occupied by him. The spill cannot occur while he is inside because he would have seen or caused it, but he claims the floor was clean. However, the spill occurs **after** he leaves at 09:10:55 and **before** Reyes’s first entry at 09:11:30. This means Basil’s statement about the floor being clean is false.** He is lying.**2. **Reyes** enters at 09:11:30 (Door A) and exits at 09:11:40 (Door B). He correctly reports the hallway was clean during this pass.3. The spill occurs **after** Reyes leaves at 09:11:40 and **before** Lior enters at 09:11:55.

 4. **Lior** enters at 09:11:55 (Door A) and exits at 09:12:30 (Door B). He claims the spill was already there when he entered, which is consistent with the spill occurring before 09:11:55.5. **Reyes’s second pass** (09:12:45–09:12:55) finds the spill, which matches his factual reporting duty.Thus, the only contradiction is Basil’s statement. **Basil is lying.** The spill occurred between **09:11:40** and **09:11:55**. 

 **Final Answer:**

 1. Spill occurred between **09:11:40** and **09:11:55**.  
 2. **Basil** must be lying.  
 3. The timeline and statements align as above.
