### 1. When did the spill occur?

 The spill occurred between **09:11:40** and **09:12:45**.


### 2. Who must be lying?

 **Lior** must be lying.
### 3. Explanation

#### Badge Log Analysis

- **Basil**: Entered at **09:10:50** at Door B and exited at **09:10:55** at Door A. This means Basil was inside the hallway from **09:10:50** to **09:10:55**.
- **Reyes (First Pass)**: Entered at **09:11:30** at Door A and exited at **09:11:40** at Door B. This means Reyes was inside the hallway from **09:11:30** to **09:11:40**.
- **Lior**: Entered at **09:11:55** at Door A and exited at **09:12:30** at Door B. This means Lior was inside the hallway from **09:11:55** to **09:12:30**.
- **Reyes (Second Pass)**: Entered at **09:12:45** at Door B and exited at **09:12:55** at Door A. This means Reyes was inside the hallway from **09:12:45** to **09:12:55**.
#### Statement Analysis

- **Basil**: Claims the floor was clean when he walked from B to A around 09:11. Since he was only inside the hallway from **09:10:50** to **09:10:55**, he could not have been in the hallway at 09:11. Therefore, Basil's statement about the floor being clean at 09:11 is irrelevant to the actual time of the spill. Basil does not necessarily lie about the floor being clean during his actual time inside.
- **Lior**: Claims the spill was already there when he entered around 09:12 and that he did not cause it. Lior was inside the hallway from **09:11:55** to **09:12:30**. If the spill occurred before he entered, his statement could be true. However, we need to check the timeline.
- **Reyes**: 
    - First pass (09:11:30–09:11:40): Claims the hallway was completely clean. Since he was inside during this time, his statement must be accurate because he is a security guard and his statements about hallway conditions are factual.
    - Second pass (09:12:45–09:12:55): Claims he saw a fresh coffee spill. Since he is a security guard, this statement is also factual.
    
   
#### Determining the Spill Time

   
- The spill cannot occur when the hallway is empty. The hallway is empty only between **09:10:55** and **09:11:30** 
.
- During **09:11:30**–**09:11:40**, Reyes was inside and claims the hallway was clean. Therefore, the spill did not occur during this time.
- The next possible time for the spill is between **09:11:40** and **09:11:55** when the hallway was empty.
- Lior entered at **09:11:55** and claims the spill was already there. If the spill occurred between **09:11:40** and **09:11:55** then Lior's claim that the spill was already there when he entered is true. 
- However, Reyes on his second pass at **09:12:45** claims he saw a *fresh* spill. This implies the spill occurred not long before he saw it, which would be inconsistent with it happening as early as **09:11:40**
   

   
To reconcile this:

- The most consistent interpretation is that the spill occurred between **09:11:40** and **09:11:55** This window satisfies:
   
    - The hallway was not empty during the spill.
   
   
### Conclusion

   
- **Spill Time**: Between **09:11:40** and **09:12:45**.
- **Lying**: **Lior** must be lying because if the spill occurred after he entered (**09:11:55**), his claim that it was already there when he entered is false.
   
### Final Answer

   

1. The spill occurred between **09:11:40** and **09:12:45**.  
   
2. **Lior** must be lying. 
  
3. The spill occurred in the time window
