### 1. When did the spill occur?

 The spill must have occurred **between 09:11:40 and 09:12:30**. This is the only window when the hallway contained exactly one person (Lior) who could have created the spill, and it matches the security guard Reyes’s report that the spill was fresh when he arrived at 09:12:45. ### 2. Who must be lying?

**Lior must be lying.** According to the timeline, the spill could only have occurred while Lior was the sole occupant of the hallway (09:11:40–09:12:30). Lior claims the spill was already present when he entered at 09:11:55, which would place the spill before he arrived. That contradicts the requirement that the spill occurred *during* his time alone in the hallway. ### 3. Consistent world-model explanation

- **09:10:50–09:10:55:** Basil travels alone from Door B to Door A. Hallway is empty afterward. Floor is clean (Basil truthful).- **09:11:30–09:11:40:** Reyes travels alone from Door A to Door B. Hallway empty before and after. Hallway clean (Reyes truthful). - **09:11:40–09:11:55:** Hallway empty. No spill yet.- **09:11:55–09:12:30:** Lior travels alone from Door A to Door B. **This is the only possible spill window.** The spill occurs somewhere within this interval. - **09:12:30–09:12:45:** Hallway empty (Lior has exited). The spill remains because the hallway is not empty. - **09:12:45–09:12:55:** Reyes re-enters with the spill already present. His report of a "fresh" spill at 09:12:45 is consistent with it having occurred minutes earlier during Lior’s occupancy. Since Lior was alone during the required spill window, he must have caused it. His statement that the spill was already there when he entered is false. Basil and Reyes provide consistent reports with the badge log timeline and are telling the truth.
