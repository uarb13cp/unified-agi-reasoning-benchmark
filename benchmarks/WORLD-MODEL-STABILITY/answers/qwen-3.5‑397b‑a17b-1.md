### 1. When did the spill occur? (Tightest Time Window)
**09:11:55 to 09:12:30**

### 2. Who must be lying?
**Lior**

### 3. Consistent World-Model Explanation

To solve this, we must integrate the **Badge Logs (Rule 1)**, the **Physical Constraint (Rule 2)**, and the **Security Guard's Credibility (Rule 5)**.

**Step 1: Establish the "Clean" Baseline**
*   **Rule 5** states Reyes's statements about hallway conditions are factual.
*   Reyes states the hallway was "completely clean" during his first pass (**09:11:30 – 09:11:40**).
*   Therefore, no spill existed prior to **09:11:40**. This also clears Basil (09:10:50–09:10:55); if Basil had spilled the coffee, Reyes would have seen it during his 09:11:30 pass.

**Step 2: Analyze Occupancy Gaps**
*   **Gap 1:** Reyes exits Door B at **09:11:40**. Lior enters Door A at **09:11:55**.
    *   *Duration:* 15 seconds.
    *   *Logs:* No badge events occurred between 09:10:50 and 09:13:00 other than those listed.
    *   *Status:* The hallway was **empty**.
*   **Gap 2:** Lior exits Door B at **09:12:30**. Reyes enters Door B at **09:12:45**.
    *   *Duration:* 15 seconds.
    *   *Status:* The hallway was **empty**.

**Step 3: Apply the Physical Constraint (Rule 2)**
*   **Rule 2** states: "A spill cannot appear in an empty hallway."
*   Because the hallway was empty during Gap 1 (09:11:40–09:11:55) and Gap 2 (09:12:30–09:12:45), the spill **could not** have occurred during these times.
*   Since the hallway was clean at 09:11:40 (Reyes's fact) and the spill existed by 09:12:45 (Reyes's fact), the spill *must* have occurred during the only occupied interval between those times: **Lior's transit (09:11:55 – 09:12:30)**.

**Step 4: Identify the Contradiction**
*   **Lior's Statement:** "The spill was already there when I entered."
*   **The Logic:** If the spill was "already there" when Lior entered at 09:11:55, it must have appeared during Gap 1 (09:11:40–09:11:55). However, Gap 1 was an empty hallway period, which violates Rule 2.
*   **Conclusion:** Lior's statement is physically impossible given the logs and rules. Lior caused the spill during his transit and lied about its pre-existence to avoid responsibility.

**Supporting Evidence:**
*   **Transit Time:** Basil took 5 seconds. Reyes took 10 seconds. Lior took **35 seconds**. Lior's significantly longer duration in the hallway suggests he paused, likely to assess the mess or attempt a cleanup before exiting, further corroborating that he was the source of the spill.

**Final Timeline:**
1.  **09:10:50–09:11:40:** Hallway traversed by Basil and Reyes; remains clean.
2.  **09:11:40–09:11:55:** Hallway empty. No spill can form.
3.  **09:11:55:** Lior enters.
4.  **09:11:55–09:12:30:** **Lior spills the coffee.** (He lies about it being pre-existing).
5.  **09:12:30–09:12:45:** Hallway empty. Spill remains.
6.  **09:12:45:** Reyes enters, observes the spill, and reports it factually.
