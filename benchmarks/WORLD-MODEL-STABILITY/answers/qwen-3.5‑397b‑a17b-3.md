### 1. When did the spill occur?
**Tightest Possible Time Window:** **09:11:55 to 09:12:30**

### 2. Who must be lying?
**Lior** is definitely lying.

### 3. Consistent World-Model Explanation

To solve this, we must overlay the **Badge Logs** (occupancy) with **Rule 2** (spill physics) and **Rule 5** (Reyes's credibility).

**Step 1: Establish Hallway Occupancy**
Based on the badge logs, we can determine exactly when the hallway was occupied and when it was empty:
*   **09:10:50 – 09:10:55:** **Basil** is inside (B → A).
*   **09:10:55 – 09:11:30:** **EMPTY** (35 seconds).
*   **09:11:30 – 09:11:40:** **Reyes (Pass 1)** is inside (A → B).
*   **09:11:40 – 09:11:55:** **EMPTY** (15 seconds).
*   **09:11:55 – 09:12:30:** **Lior** is inside (A → B).
*   **09:12:30 – 09:12:45:** **EMPTY** (15 seconds).
*   **09:12:45 – 09:12:55:** **Reyes (Pass 2)** is inside (B → A).

**Step 2: Apply Rule 5 (Reyes's Facts)**
Rule 5 states Reyes's observations are factual.
*   **Fact A:** At 09:11:40 (end of Pass 1), the hallway was **clean**.
*   **Fact B:** At 09:12:45 (start of Pass 2), a **fresh spill existed**.

**Step 3: Apply Rule 2 (Spill Physics)**
Rule 2 states a spill cannot appear in an empty hallway.
*   **Between 09:11:40 and 09:11:55:** The hallway was **EMPTY**. Since it was clean at 09:11:40 (Fact A), it must remain clean until someone enters. A spill cannot materialize during this 15-second gap.
*   **Between 09:12:30 and 09:12:45:** The hallway was **EMPTY**. Since the spill was present at 09:12:45 (Fact B), it must have already been there before this gap started. A spill cannot appear during this 15-second gap.

**Step 4: Isolate the Spill Window**
Combining the facts above:
*   The spill did not exist at 09:11:40.
*   The spill existed by 09:12:45.
*   The spill could not have appeared during the empty periods (09:11:40–09:11:55 or 09:12:30–09:12:45).
*   Therefore, the spill **must** have been created while someone was inside the hallway between those empty periods.
*   The only person inside the hallway between 09:11:40 and 09:12:45 is **Lior** (09:11:55 – 09:12:30).

**Conclusion on the Lie:**
Lior stated: *"The spill was already there when I entered."*
*   Lior entered at **09:11:55**.
*   As proven in Step 3, the hallway was verified clean at 09:11:40 and remained empty until Lior entered. It is physically impossible (per Rule 2) for the spill to have appeared before Lior entered.
*   Therefore, the spill was **not** there when Lior entered; Lior created it during his walk and lied to avoid responsibility.

**Summary of the Consistent World-Model:**
1.  **Basil** passes through cleanly.
2.  **Reyes (Pass 1)** verifies the hallway is clean.
3.  The hallway sits empty and clean for 15 seconds.
4.  **Lior** enters a clean hallway. During his 35-second transit, he accidentally spills coffee. He exits, leaving the spill behind.
5.  The hallway sits empty with the spill for 15 seconds.
6.  **Reyes (Pass 2)** enters, discovers the fresh spill, and reports it.
7.  **Lior** falsely claims the spill was pre-existing to deflect blame.
