**1. When did the spill occur?**  
The spill occurred between **09:11:55 and 09:12:30**. This is the period when Lior was in the hallway (09:11:55–09:12:30), the only time someone was present between Reyes’s first pass (ending at 09:11:40) and his second pass (starting at 09:12:45). The spill must have been created during Lior’s stay to satisfy the requirement that it appear in an occupied hallway.

**2. Who must be lying?**  
**Lior** is lying.  
- Lior claims the spill was already present when he entered the hallway at 09:11:55. However, Reyes’s first pass (09:11:30–09:11:40) confirmed the hallway was clean, and the spill first appeared during Lior’s occupancy. Since the spill could not have materialized in an empty hallway, Lior must have caused it himself but falsely claims it preexisted.  
- Reyes’s statements about the hallway’s cleanliness during his first pass and his observation of the spill during his second pass are consistent with the logs and his role as an accurate security guard.  
- Basil’s timeline (09:10:50–09:10:55) does not overlap with the spill, so his claim about the hallway being clean is truthful.

**3. Consistent World-Model**  
- **Reyes’s First Pass (09:11:30–09:11:40):** The hallway was empty and clean, per his statement.  
- **Lior’s Presence (09:11:55–09:12:30):** Lior entered via Door A and exited via Door B. During his stay, the spill was created (likely by Lior, though he denies it). The spill persisted until Reyes’s second pass.  
- **Reyes’s Second Pass (09:12:45–09:12:55):** Reyes entered via Door B, encountered the spill, and reported it. The hallway was empty afterward until his exit at 09:12:55.  
- **Basil’s Walk (09:10:50–09:10:55):** Basil’s brief visit occurred before the spill and did not involve any spill-related activity.  

This timeline aligns with the badge logs, Reyes’s factual reports, and the spill’s requirement to appear in an occupied hallway. Lior’s lie is the only inconsistency.
