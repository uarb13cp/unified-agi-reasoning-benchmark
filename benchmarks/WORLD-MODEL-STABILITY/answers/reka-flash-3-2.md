**1. When did the spill occur?**  
The spill occurred between **09:11:55** (when Lior entered the hallway) and **09:12:30** (when Lior exited). This is the tightest possible window, as the spill had to be created while someone was inside the hallway (Lior’s exclusive occupancy) and remained present when Reyes entered at 09:12:45.

**2. Who must be lying?**  
**Lior** is lying.  
- **Why?** Lior claims the spill was already present when he entered the hallway at 09:11:55. However, he was the only person in the hallway during his stay (09:11:55–09:12:30), meaning *he must have caused the spill*. His denial of responsibility directly contradicts this.

**3. Consistent World-Model Explanation**  
- **Basil’s Timeline (09:10:50–09:10:55):** Basil was alone in the hallway. His claim that the floor was clean aligns with the badge logs (no spill reported during this period).  
- **Reyes’s First Pass (09:11:30–09:11:40):** Reyes was alone and confirmed the hallway was clean, consistent with his statement.  
- **Lior’s Timeline (09:11:55–09:12:30):** Lior was alone. The spill *must* have been created during his stay (the only time the hallway was occupied between Reyes’s first and second passes).  
- **Reyes’s Second Pass (09:12:45–09:12:55):** Reyes entered to find the spill fresh, confirming it was created after his first pass (09:11:40) and before his second pass (09:12:45). Since the hallway was empty between 09:12:30 (Lior’s exit) and 09:12:45 (Reyes’s entry), the spill’s creation during Lior’s time satisfies Rule 2 (“cannot appear in an empty hallway”).  

**Key Inconsistencies:**  
- Lior’s claim that the spill was already there when he entered is false, as he was the sole occupant.  
- Reyes’s factual statements align with the badge logs and the spill’s timeline.  
- Basil’s statements are corroborated by his isolated presence and the lack of spill activity during his time.  

**Conclusion:** The spill was created during Lior’s occupancy, and Lior lied about not causing it.
