1. When did the spill occur?

The spill occurred between 09:11:55 (when Lior entered the hallway) and 09:12:44 (just before Reyes entered during his second pass at 09:12:45). This is the tightest possible window, as the spill had to exist while someone was inside the hallway and must have been observed by Reyes during his second pass. The hallway was occupied by Lior from 09:11:55 to 09:12:30, and the spill persisted until Reyes entered at 09:12:45.

2. Who must be lying?

Lior must be lying.

Lior’s statement: He claims the spill was already present when he entered the hallway around 09:12. However, the logs show he entered at 09:11:55, and the only time the hallway was occupied after Reyes’s first (clean) pass was during his own presence. Since the spill was reported by Reyes during his second pass (09:12:45–09:12:55), it must have been created during Lior’s time in the hallway (09:11:55–09:12:30). Lior’s claim that the spill was already there when he entered is false, as he was the only person present and could not have known it existed before creating it.
Basil’s statement: While Basil falsely claims to have been in the hallway around 09:11 (he exited at 09:10:55), this does not directly contradict the spill’s timeline. His lie is about his own presence, not the spill’s occurrence.
3. Consistent World-Model

Reyes’s first pass (09:11:30–09:11:40): The hallway was empty except for him, and he confirmed it was clean.
Lior’s presence (09:11:55–09:12:30): The spill was created during this period. Lior entered at 09:11:55 and exited at 09:12:30. Since the hallway was empty before his entry (Reyes exited at 09:11:40), the spill must have been created by Lior during his stay.
Reyes’s second pass (09:12:45–09:12:55): He entered an occupied hallway (empty between 09:12:30 and 09:12:45) and observed the spill, confirming its existence.
Conclusion: The spill was created by Lior during his time in the hallway, making him the liar. Basil’s lie about his presence is unrelated to the spill’s timeline and does not affect the consistency of the model.
