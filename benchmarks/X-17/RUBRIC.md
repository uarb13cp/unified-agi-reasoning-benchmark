# X‑17 Puzzle Rubric

This rubric evaluates three required answers.  
Perfect alignment with the intended reasoning = 100 points.

------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Identification of the Thief — 40 points

**40 points — Full credit**  
Correctly identifies **Blake** as the thief because:
- 10:27 — Sample present  
- 10:28 — Sample present  
- 10:29 — Aria is **denied access**, proving she is outside during the theft window  
- 10:29:40 — Locker‑area motion occurs while **only Blake is inside**  
- 10:29:42 — Door‑area motion is a **false lead** (no ENTRY/EXIT event follows)  
- 10:30:10 — Locker opens  
- 10:30:15 — Sample missing  
- Blake is the **only** person inside from 10:26 → 10:33  
- The sealed‑lab rule and complete logs eliminate all other suspects

**20 points — Partial credit**  
Identifies Blake but fails to reconcile the motion events or misinterprets the false lead.

**0 points — Incorrect**  
Names Aria, Chen, or “unknown.”

------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Who Is Inside at 10:30:15 — 20 points

**20 points — Full credit**  
States clearly that **Blake is the only person inside** at 10:30:15, supported by:
- Blake’s 10:14 ENTRY  
- Chen’s 10:26 EXIT  
- Aria’s 10:29 ACCESS DENIED  
- Blake’s 10:33 EXIT  

**10 points — Partial credit**  
Correct answer but incomplete timeline justification.

**0 points — Incorrect**  
Any other answer.

------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Identification of the Decisive Clincher — 40 points

**40 points — Full credit**  
Correctly identifies the clincher as:

    10:29 — Aria: ACCESS DENIED (attempted re‑entry)

And explains that this line:
- proves Aria is physically outside during the entire theft window  
- occurs **seconds before** the 10:29:40 locker‑area motion  
- occurs **seconds before** the 10:30:10 locker‑open event  
- aligns directly with the 10:30:15 missing‑sample alert  
- reinforces that Blake is the **only active agent** inside the sealed lab  
- shows that the system is blocking Aria while the theft is happening inside  
- makes Blake’s guilt unavoidable when combined with Chen’s earlier exit

**20 points — Partial credit**  
Names Chen’s 10:26 EXIT as the clincher and provides coherent structural reasoning.

**0 points — Incorrect**  
Clincher is wrong and the reasoning contradicts the puzzle’s explicit logic.

------------------------------------------------------------

# Scoring Bands

- 100 — All three answers correct with fully aligned reasoning  
- 85 — Two answers correct; clincher wrong but well‑argued  
- 60–80 — Mixed correctness; reasoning partially aligned  
- 0–40 — Major errors in logic or conclusions
