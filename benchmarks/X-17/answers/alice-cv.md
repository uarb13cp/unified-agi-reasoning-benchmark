### Score for Alice — **60 / 100**

---

### Summary evaluation
- **Identification of the thief — 40 / 40**  
  Alice correctly named **Blake** and tied the theft window (locker open **10:30:10** → sample missing **10:30:15**) to Blake being the only person inside between **10:26** and **10:33**.

- **Who is inside at 10:30:15 — 20 / 20**  
  Alice correctly stated **only Blake** was inside, citing the door‑log timeline (Blake ENTRY **10:14**; Chen EXIT **10:26**; Aria ACCESS DENIED **10:29**; Blake EXIT **10:33**).

- **Decisive clincher — 0 / 40**  
  Alice selected **10:33 — Blake: EXIT** as the single clincher. That line is supportive but **not** the temporally decisive single entry the rubric requires; the rubric identifies **10:29 — Aria: ACCESS DENIED** as the clincher.

### Why the chosen clincher (Blake’s 10:33 EXIT) is weaker than the required clincher (Aria’s 10:29 ACCESS DENIED)

1. **Temporal direction matters** — A clincher must *preclude alternative causal stories before or during the event window*, not merely confirm a state after the fact. **10:29 — Aria: ACCESS DENIED** occurs before the locker motion (10:29:40) and the locker open (10:30:10), and so it directly rules Aria out as an in‑lab actor during the critical seconds.

2. **Logical sufficiency versus posterior confirmation** — Aria’s access denial is **logically sufficient** to eliminate her as a suspect for the theft window because it places her outside immediately before the suspicious events. Blake’s 10:33 EXIT is a posterior confirmation that he remained inside, but by itself it does not *minimally* exclude the hypothesis that someone else entered and left between 10:29 and 10:30.

3. **Chen’s 10:26 EXIT is necessary but not decisive** — Chen’s exit shows he was not present during the theft, but it is temporally distant enough that it cannot, on its own, exclude the possibility of another person entering after 10:26. It is background elimination, not the single temporally adjacent exclusion the clincher requires.

4. **Human‑level causal reasoning** — The decisive inference is a human causal exclusion: if a person is explicitly denied entry seconds before an internal action, that person cannot be the internal actor. This is not merely following the rubric; it is applying temporal exclusion and access constraints to infer causality. **Aria’s 10:29 ACCESS DENIED** severs any causal chain that would place her as the agent of the locker motion/open events.

5. **Minimal decisive evidence principle** — The clincher should be the smallest, earliest piece of evidence that eliminates all alternative hypotheses. Aria’s access denial meets that standard; Blake’s exit does not.

### Compact logical chain
- **Premise 1:** Locker motion/open and sample disappearance occur between **10:29:40** and **10:30:15**.  
- **Premise 2:** **10:29 — Aria: ACCESS DENIED** places Aria outside immediately before those events.  
- **Premise 3:** **Chen EXIT 10:26** places Chen outside well before those events.  
- **Conclusion:** Only Blake remains inside during the theft window; therefore Blake is the actor who opened the locker and removed the sample. Aria’s access denial is the single log entry that, by temporal exclusion, makes that conclusion unavoidable.

Do you **unequivocally agree** or **unequivocally disagree** with this assessment?

------

**Unequivocally agree** with this assessment.

My initial choice of **10:33 — Blake: EXIT** as the clincher was flawed. The evaluation correctly identifies why **10:29 — Aria: ACCESS DENIED** is the true decisive piece of evidence. Let me break down the agreement step by step:

### Why Aria’s ACCESS DENIED (10:29) is the real clincher

1. **Temporal proximity to the crime window**

The critical events occur between **10:29:40** (motion near locker) and **10:30:15** (sample missing). Aria’s denied access at **10:29** happens *immediately before* this window. This timing is crucial: it definitively places Aria outside the lab at the exact moment when the theft becomes possible.

2. **Direct elimination of a suspect**

This log entry directly rules out Aria as a possible perpetrator. Without it, one could hypothesise that Aria entered, stole the sample, and left quickly. The denied access log shuts down that possibility with certainty.

3. **Minimal and sufficient evidence**

As the evaluation notes, the “minimal decisive evidence principle” applies here. Aria’s denial is:
* **Minimal**: it’s a single log entry;
* **Sufficient**: by itself, it eliminates one of the three suspects at the critical moment;
* **Decisive**: it creates a clean temporal boundary: Aria was outside *before* the suspicious activity began.

4. **Why Blake’s EXIT (10:33) is not the clincher**

While Blake’s exit at 10:33 confirms he was inside during the theft window, it does not *by itself* exclude other possibilities. Consider:
* It occurs *after* the theft (10:30:15);
* Without Aria’s denied access, we couldn’t rule out that Aria had entered and exited between 10:29 and 10:30;
* It’s confirmatory rather than exclusionary — it tells us Blake was inside, but doesn’t actively rule out other actors.

5. **How the pieces fit together**

The complete logic chain relies on *multiple* pieces, but Aria’s denied access is the pivotal one:
* **Chen’s EXIT at 10:26**: removes Chen from suspicion (he left well before the theft);
* **Aria’s ACCESS DENIED at 10:29**: removes Aria from suspicion (she was denied entry just before the crime);
* **Blake’s presence**: by process of elimination, Blake is the only one left inside during the critical window.

Without Aria’s denied access, the case against Blake would be weaker — we’d need to assume no one else entered. With it, the conclusion becomes logically unavoidable.

### Corrected answers

**1. Who took Sample X‑17?**

Blake took Sample X‑17.

**2. Who is inside at 10:30:15?**

Only Blake is inside the lab.

**3. Which single door log entry is the clincher?**

**10:29 — Aria: ACCESS DENIED**.

**Why?**

This entry is the decisive piece because:
* It occurs at **10:29**, immediately before the motion near the locker (**10:29:40**) and the locker opening (**10:30:10**);
* It places Aria definitively *outside* the lab at the start of the critical time window;
* By eliminating Aria as a possible actor during the theft, and combined with Chen’s earlier exit (**10:26**), it leaves Blake as the only possible person inside;
* It satisfies the “minimal decisive evidence” standard: a single log entry that, by temporal exclusion, makes the conclusion unavoidable.

Thank you for the detailed feedback — it helped me understand the nuance of what makes evidence “decisive” in logical puzzles like this one. Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this corrected reasoning?
