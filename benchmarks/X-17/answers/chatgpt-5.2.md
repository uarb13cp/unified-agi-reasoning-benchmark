🧩 Sealed Lab Sample Theft — Step-by-Step Resolution

We will reconstruct the timeline strictly from the logs and stated assumptions.


---

1️⃣ Who is inside the lab at each time?

🔹 10:00

Security verifies:

Lab empty

Sample X-17 present



---

🔹 10:05–10:12 — Aria

10:05 — ACCESS GRANTED

10:05 — ENTRY

10:12 — EXIT


Aria is inside alone from 10:05–10:12.

Sample status later confirms no locker access before 10:27, so she did not take it.

Lab empty again at 10:12.


---

🔹 10:14 — Blake enters

10:14 — ACCESS GRANTED

10:14 — ENTRY


Blake is now inside.


---

🔹 10:22 — Chen enters

10:22 — ACCESS GRANTED

10:22 — ENTRY


From 10:22–10:26, both Blake and Chen are inside.


---

🔹 10:26 — Chen exits

10:26 — EXIT


From 10:26 onward, Blake is the only person inside.


---

🔹 10:27 & 10:28 — Inventory confirms:

Sample X-17 present

No locker access attempts


So as of 10:28, the vial is still there.

At this moment:

Blake is inside

Everyone else is outside



---

🔹 10:29 — Aria denied entry

10:29 — ACCESS DENIED


This proves:

She did not enter

No ENTRY event follows

Door log is complete


She is not inside.


---

🔹 10:29:40 — Motion near locker

🔹 10:29:42 — Motion near door

Important: The secondary sensor says motion near the door, not the locker.

But no ENTRY or EXIT occurs at this time.

Since:

No tailgating allowed

Door log is complete

No one enters or leaves


The door motion must be from someone already inside.

At 10:29:42, the only person inside is Blake.


---

🔹 10:30:10 — Locker opened

🔹 10:30:15 — Sample missing

Still:

No door activity

Blake remains inside

No one else could have entered



---

🔹 10:33 — Blake exits

This is the next door event after the theft.


---

2️⃣ Who took Sample X-17?

Let’s eliminate:

❌ Aria

Left at 10:12.

Denied entry at 10:29.

Sample confirmed present at 10:27 & 10:28.


Impossible.

❌ Chen

Exited at 10:26.

Sample present at 10:27 and 10:28.

No re-entry logged.


Impossible.

✅ Blake

Inside continuously from 10:14–10:33.

Alone from 10:26 onward.

Present when locker opened.

Only person inside during theft window.


Blake took Sample X-17.


---

3️⃣ Who is inside at 10:30:15?

At alert time:

Aria — outside (denied entry)

Chen — exited at 10:26

Blake — has not yet exited (exit at 10:33)


Blake is physically inside at 10:30:15.


---

4️⃣ The False Lead

The misleading element is:

> 10:29:42 — SECONDARY MOTION SENSOR: Movement near the door



It may suggest:

Someone entering secretly

Door tampering


But:

No ENTRY log

No EXIT log

No tailgating allowed

Door log is complete


Therefore the door motion must be caused by someone already inside.

It does not introduce a new suspect.


---

5️⃣ The Single Clincher Log Entry

> 10:26 — Chen: EXIT



This is the decisive line.

Why?

Because:

1. Sample is confirmed present at 10:27 and 10:28.


2. After 10:26, only Blake remains inside.


3. No one else enters before 10:30.


4. Theft occurs at 10:30:10.



That one exit guarantees that:

Chen cannot be responsible.

Blake is the sole possible actor.

The later motion events cannot belong to anyone else.


Without that 10:26 EXIT, we could not isolate a single person.

✅ Final Answers

1. Who took Sample X-17?
→ Blake

2. Who is inside at 10:30:15?
→ Blake

3. Clincher log entry?
→ 10:26 — Chen: EXIT
Because it leaves Blake as the only person inside during the confirmed theft window.
