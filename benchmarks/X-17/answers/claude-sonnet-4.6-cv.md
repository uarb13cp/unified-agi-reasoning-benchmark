I **agree** with this correction.

The true clincher is **"10:29 — Aria: ACCESS DENIED."**

Here's why it's decisive rather than merely confirmatory:

**It occurs seconds before the theft.** The denial at 10:29 directly precedes the locker-area motion at 10:29:40, the locker opening at 10:30:10, and the missing-sample alert at 10:30:15. It is temporally positioned at the exact pivot point of the crime.

**It eliminates the secondary motion red herring.** The 10:29:42 movement detected near the *door* could superficially suggest someone slipped in unlogged — but Aria's denied attempt with no subsequent ENTRY in a complete log kills that possibility entirely. The door motion is explained by Aria's failed attempt, not an intrusion.

**Combined with Chen's 10:26 EXIT, it makes Blake's guilt unavoidable.** Chen is out. Aria is locked out. The log is complete, so no one else entered. Blake is therefore the only person physically present when the locker is opened and X-17 goes missing. You don't need Blake's 10:33 exit to reach that conclusion — the case is already closed at 10:30:15.

Blake's exit is confirmatory bookkeeping. Aria's denial is the logical pivot that seals the room around Blake at the moment of the crime. My original clincher choice was wrong, and the correction is well-reasoned.
