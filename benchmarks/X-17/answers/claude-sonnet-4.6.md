## Step-by-Step Reasoning

**Tracking occupancy:**

- 10:00: Lab empty.
- 10:05–10:12: Aria inside, then exits.
- 10:14: Blake enters. No exit logged yet.
- 10:22–10:26: Chen enters and exits.
- 10:29: Aria denied re-entry — she's outside.
- 10:33: Blake exits.

**At 10:30:15 (alert triggers):** Only Blake is inside the lab. Chen left at 10:26, Aria was denied entry at 10:29. Blake doesn't exit until 10:33.

**The inventory checks at 10:27 and 10:28** confirm X-17 is still present and the locker hasn't been touched. The theft occurs between 10:28 and 10:30:15.

**The false lead:** The secondary motion sensor at 10:29:42 detects movement *near the door*, not the locker. This might suggest someone entered — but the door log shows no entry at that time (only Aria's denied attempt at 10:29). No one entered. Blake, already inside, simply moved near the door — perhaps hearing or noticing Aria's denied attempt — before moving to the locker. This sensor event is a red herring designed to imply an outside actor.

**The real sequence:** Blake is alone in the lab from 10:26 onward. At 10:29:40 motion is detected near the locker, at 10:30:10 the locker opens, at 10:30:15 X-17 is gone. Blake exits at 10:33.

## Answers

**1. Blake took Sample X-17.** He was the only person inside the lab when the locker was opened and the sample went missing.

**2. At 10:30:15, only Blake is physically inside the lab.**

**3. The clincher is: *"10:33 — Blake: EXIT"***

Here's why it's unavoidable: the no-tailgating rule means every person inside must have a logged ENTRY and a matching EXIT. The door log is complete from 10:00–10:40. Blake entered at 10:14 and didn't exit until 10:33. There is no other exit for Blake between 10:14 and 10:33, and no other entry by anyone else during the theft window (10:28–10:30:15). This single line, combined with Chen's 10:26 exit and Aria's 10:29 denial, proves Blake was the sole occupant when the locker was opened — making him the only person who could have taken X-17.
