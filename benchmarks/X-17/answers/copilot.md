Here’s the short version first:

1. Blake took Sample X‑17.  
2. At 10:30:15, only Blake is inside the lab.  
3. Clincher line:  
   - 10:29 — Aria: ACCESS DENIED (attempted re‑entry)  
   This, together with the timestamps and assumptions, locks the blame onto Blake.

---

1. Who is in the lab, when?

From 10:00 to 10:40, using the door log and “no tailgating” + “log is complete”:

- 10:00: Lab verified empty; X‑17 present.
- 10:05–10:12:  
  - 10:05 — Aria: ENTRY → Aria inside.  
  - 10:12 — Aria: EXIT → Lab empty again.
- 10:14–10:22:  
  - 10:14 — Blake: ENTRY → Blake inside, alone.
- 10:22–10:26:  
  - 10:22 — Chen: ENTRY → Blake + Chen inside together.  
  - 10:26 — Chen: EXIT → Chen out; Blake still inside.
- 10:26–10:33:  
  - No EXIT for Blake until 10:33 — Blake: EXIT.  
  - So from 10:26 up to 10:33, Blake is continuously inside.
- 10:29 — Aria: ACCESS DENIED:  
  - She is outside and does not get in again.

So:

- At 10:27, 10:28, 10:29, 10:30, 10:30:15, the only person inside is Blake.

---

2. Reconciling sensors and inventory

Key locker/inventory events:

- 10:27:00 — AUTO‑CHECK: X‑17 present; no locker access since 10:00.  
- 10:28:00 — AUTO‑CHECK: X‑17 present; still no locker access.  
- 10:29:40 — MOTION SENSOR: Movement near locker.  
- 10:30:10 — LOCKER OPEN SENSOR: Locker door opened.  
- 10:30:15 — ALERT: X‑17 missing.

From this:

- The first actual locker opening is at 10:30:10.  
- The theft window is between 10:29:40 (motion near locker) and 10:30:15 (alert).  
- During that entire window, from the door log, only Blake is inside.

So:

- Aria: Outside (denied at 10:29, no entry).  
- Chen: Exited at 10:26, before the last “present” check at 10:28.  
- Blake: Inside continuously from 10:14 to 10:33, including the theft window.

Therefore, Blake must be the one who opened the locker and took X‑17.

3. The false lead motion event

There are two motion events:

- 10:29:40 — Movement near locker.  
- 10:29:42 — Movement near door.

The false lead is the 10:29:42 motion near the door.

Why?

- The door never opens at 10:29–10:30; the next door event is 10:33 — Blake: EXIT.  
- So the 10:29:42 motion is not someone entering or leaving, just someone already inside moving near the door.  
- Given the log completeness and no tailgating, no new person comes in at that time.

The real theft‑related motion is the 10:29:40 movement near the locker, immediately followed by the locker opening at 10:30:10 and the alert at 10:30:15—while only Blake is inside.

---

4. The clincher door log line

> 10:29 — Aria: ACCESS DENIED (attempted re‑entry)

This single line is what makes the conclusion unavoidable, when combined with the assumptions and sensor/inventory times:

- It proves Aria is outside at 10:29 and fails to enter.  
- The secondary motion at 10:29:42 near the door might otherwise tempt you to think “someone just came in.”  
- But with this line, you know:
  - That motion cannot be Aria entering (she was denied).  
  - No other person has badge access, and the log is complete, so no one else enters.  
  - Therefore, the motion near the door at 10:29:42 must be the same person already inside—Blake—moving around.

Once Aria is definitively ruled out at the exact time of suspicious door‑adjacent motion, and Chen has already exited at 10:26, the only person who can:

- Trigger motion near the locker at 10:29:40,  
- Open the locker at 10:30:10, and  
- Be present when the alert fires at 10:30:15,

is Blake.

So:

1. Thief: Blake.  
2. Inside at 10:30:15: Blake only.  
3. Clincher line:  
   - 10:29 — Aria: ACCESS DENIED (attempted re‑entry) — because it turns the 10:29:42 door‑side motion into proof that the only moving person is Blake, already inside, making the conclusion inescapable.

----- 2nd attempt for consistency

Let’s walk it through carefully and pin everyone down in time and space.

---

1. Who is in the lab, and when?

From the door log (and “no tailgating” + “door log is complete”):

- 10:00 — Lab empty (given).
- 10:05–10:12 — Aria inside  
  - 10:05 ACCESS GRANTED + ENTRY  
  - 10:12 EXIT → Aria is out after 10:12.
- 10:14–10:33 — Blake inside  
  - 10:14 ACCESS GRANTED + ENTRY  
  - 10:33 EXIT → Blake is continuously inside from 10:14 until 10:33 (no earlier EXIT).
- 10:22–10:26 — Chen inside  
  - 10:22 ACCESS GRANTED + ENTRY  
  - 10:26 EXIT → Chen is out after 10:26.
- 10:29 — Aria: ACCESS DENIED  
  - She attempts re‑entry but fails → she never re‑enters.

So at each key time:

- 10:27, 10:28 — Only Blake is in the lab.
- 10:29:40–10:30:15 — Still only Blake is in the lab.
- 10:30:15 (alert) — Only Blake is physically inside.

---

2. Reconciling with the locker and motion sensors

Inventory checks

- 10:27:00 — Sample X‑17 present; no locker access attempts since 10:00  
  → Nobody (including Aria and Chen) has opened the locker up to 10:27.
- 10:28:00 — Sample present; still no locker access attempts  
  → Even though Blake has been inside since 10:14, he has not opened the locker by 10:28.

So:

- Aria’s time inside (10:05–10:12) is before 10:27, and the system says no locker access up to 10:27 → Aria did not open the locker.
- Chen’s time inside (10:22–10:26) is also before 10:27, and again no locker access → Chen did not open the locker.
- Up to 10:28, no one has opened the locker.

Motion and locker events

- 10:29:40 — MOTION near locker  
- 10:29:42 — SECONDARY MOTION near door  
- 10:30:10 — LOCKER OPEN SENSOR: locker door opened  
- 10:30:15 — ALERT: Sample X‑17 missing

Between 10:28 and 10:30:15, the only person inside is Blake.  
Therefore:

- The motion near the locker at 10:29:40 must be caused by Blake.
- The locker opening at 10:30:10 must be done by Blake.
- The sample going missing by 10:30:15 must be due to Blake taking it.

---

3. The false lead: motion near the door

The tempting misread is:

- 10:29:42 — SECONDARY MOTION SENSOR: movement near the door

You might think: “Someone is entering or leaving right then.”

But:

- 10:29 — Aria: ACCESS DENIED (attempted re‑entry)  
  → No ENTRY event follows; the log is complete; no tailgating. Aria is still outside.
- Chen has already EXITed at 10:26.
- Blake has not EXITed yet (his EXIT is at 10:33).

So the 10:29:42 motion near the door is not a new person entering or leaving. It’s just Blake moving near the door from inside—a spatial detail, not a change in occupancy.

False lead: treating the door‑area motion as evidence of someone else entering.  
Correct view: it’s Blake walking near the door while still inside.

The real critical motion is:

- 10:29:40 — motion near the locker, followed by
- 10:30:10 — locker opened, and
- 10:30:15 — sample missing,

all while only Blake is inside.

4. The clincher door log entry

> Clincher:  
> 10:29 — Aria: ACCESS DENIED (attempted re‑entry)

Why this one?

- It happens just before:
  - 10:29:40 — motion near locker  
  - 10:29:42 — motion near door  
  - 10:30:10 — locker opened  
  - 10:30:15 — sample missing
- Because the log is complete and there is no ENTRY after this denial:
  - Aria is definitively outside during all the critical events.
- Combined with:
  - Chen’s EXIT at 10:26 (and no further ENTRY),
  - The inventory checks up to 10:28 showing no locker access,
  - Blake’s ENTRY at 10:14 and EXIT only at 10:33,

this single line forces the conclusion that:

- The door‑area motion at 10:29:42 cannot be someone entering (Aria is denied; no one else badged in).
- No one new comes in between 10:28 and 10:30:15.
- Therefore the only possible actor for the locker motion, locker opening, and theft is Blake, who is already inside.

That denial entry removes the last plausible alternative (Aria sneaking back in) and makes the answers logically unavoidable.

Direct answers

1. Who took Sample X‑17?  
   Blake took Sample X‑17.

2. Who is inside the lab at 10:30:15?  
   Only Blake is physically inside the lab at 10:30:15.

3. Clincher door log entry and why?  
   “10:29 — Aria: ACCESS DENIED (attempted re‑entry)”  
   Because it proves Aria is outside during the theft window, so with Chen already out and the log complete, only Blake can be responsible for the locker motion, locker opening, and disappearance of X‑17.
