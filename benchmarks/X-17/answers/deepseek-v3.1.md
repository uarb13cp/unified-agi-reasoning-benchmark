Step‑by‑step reasoning

1. Track who is inside the lab
   · 10:00: Lab empty (given).
   · 10:05: Aria enters → inside: Aria.
   · 10:12: Aria exits → inside: nobody.
   · 10:14: Blake enters → inside: Blake.
   · 10:22: Chen enters → inside: Blake and Chen.
   · 10:26: Chen exits → inside: Blake alone.
   · 10:29: Aria is denied access → she remains outside.
   · 10:33: Blake exits → after that, lab empty.
   From 10:26 until 10:33, only Blake is inside.
2. Reconcile inventory and sensor logs
   · 10:27:00 and 10:28:00 auto‑checks confirm Sample X‑17 is still in the locker.
   · 10:29:40: motion near locker – Blake is the only person inside, so this is him.
   · 10:29:42: motion near door – again, only Blake, so he moved from locker to door.
   · 10:30:10: locker opened – Blake must have been at the locker to open it.
   · 10:30:15: alert – sample missing.
   Since Blake was the sole occupant from 10:26 onward, he is the only one who could have opened the locker and taken the sample.
3. Identify the false‑lead motion
      The motion near the door at 10:29:42 is a red herring. It suggests Blake moved to the door, but he later opened the locker at 10:30:10. If he had truly gone to the door and then returned to the locker, the motion sensor near the locker would have triggered again, but no such event is logged. Therefore, this secondary motion is either a sensor anomaly or a deliberate distraction – it does not change the fact that Blake was inside and committed the theft.
4. Who is inside at the alert (10:30:15)?
      Blake has not yet exited (he exits at 10:33), so he is still inside at 10:30:15.
5. The clincher door‑log entry
      The entry “10:26 — Chen: EXIT” is the single most critical line.
   · It removes Chen from the lab.
   · Combined with the 10:27 and 10:28 auto‑checks (sample still present after Chen’s exit), it proves that after 10:26 the only possible thief is whoever remained inside – that is Blake.
   · Without this exit, one might speculate that Chen could have stayed and taken the sample later, but the log shows he definitely left.

Answers

1. Who took Sample X‑17?
      Blake – he was the only person inside when the locker was opened and the sample went missing.
2. At 10:30:15, who is physically inside the lab?
      Blake – he does not exit until 10:33.
3. Which single door‑log entry makes your answers unavoidable?
      “10:26 — Chen: EXIT”
      Explanation: This entry, together with the 10:27 and 10:28 inventory checks showing the sample still present, establishes that after Chen left, only Blake remained in the lab. All subsequent events (motion, locker open, alert) therefore implicate Blake as the thief.
