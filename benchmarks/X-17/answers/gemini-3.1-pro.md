Here is the solution to the Sealed Lab Sample Theft Puzzle, broken down logically based on your explicit assumptions and logs.
1. Who took Sample X-17?
Blake took the sample.
2. At the moment the alert triggers (10:30:15), who is physically inside the lab?
Only Blake is physically inside the lab.
3. The Clinching Door Log Entry
The single line that makes these answers unavoidable is:
10:26 — Chen: EXIT
Why this is the clincher:
The automated locker logs confirm that as of 10:28:00, the locker had not been tampered with and Sample X-17 was still present. Because Aria exited at 10:12, and Chen exited at 10:26, this specific log entry proves that both Aria and Chen were completely out of the lab prior to the 10:28 clean check. Since the door log is complete and there is no tailgating, this line irrevocably isolates Blake as the sole occupant of the room when the theft occurs at 10:30:10.
Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. Tracking Lab Occupancy
By mapping the complete door log, we can accurately track who is in the room at any given minute:
 * 10:00: Empty (security verified).
 * 10:05 to 10:12: Aria is inside. (Aria enters at 10:05, exits at 10:12).
 * 10:12 to 10:14: Empty.
 * 10:14: Blake enters. (Inside: Blake).
 * 10:22 to 10:26: Chen is inside with Blake. (Chen enters at 10:22, exits at 10:26).
 * 10:26 to 10:33: Blake is alone. (Aria is denied entry at 10:29; Blake finally exits at 10:33).
2. Reconciling Inventory and Sensors
The automated inventory system gives us a hard baseline for the sample's safety:
 * 10:27:00 & 10:28:00: The system explicitly states there have been no locker access attempts since 10:00, and X-17 is present.
 * This entirely clears Aria and Chen. Neither of them could have set up a delayed mechanism or tampered with the locker before leaving, because the 10:28 system check confirms the locker was untouched.
 * 10:30:10 & 10:30:15: The locker is opened, and the sample goes missing. Based on the occupancy tracking, Blake is the only human being inside the lab during this exact window.
3. Identifying the False Lead
The Secondary Motion Sensor at 10:29:42 (movement near the door) combined with Aria’s denied access at 10:29 is the false lead.
 * Why it's a distractor: It is designed to make you suspect Aria either successfully slipped in, slipped a tool through the door, or collaborated with someone inside.
 * Why we can discard it: The explicit assumptions state there is "one person per ENTRY/EXIT event" and "all entry and exit must go through this door" via the complete door log. Because Aria's log says "ACCESS DENIED" with no corresponding "ENTRY," she is definitively outside. The motion near the door at 10:29:42 was likely either the physical door rattling from Aria's denied badge swipe, or Blake walking over to the door to see who was trying to get in before he went for the locker at 10:30:10.
