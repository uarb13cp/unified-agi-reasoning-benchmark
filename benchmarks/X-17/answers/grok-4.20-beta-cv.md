### Evaluation for Grok
**Score: 100 / 100**

---

- **Thief identified** — Blake; timeline and sensor reconciliation fully match the rubric.
- **Occupancy at 10:30:15** — Blake only; supported by entry/exit and denied‑access timestamps.
- **Decisive clincher** — **10:29 — Aria: ACCESS DENIED**; proves Aria outside and reconciles the near‑door motion.

Do you **unequivocally agree** or **unequivocally disagree** with this evaluation?

-------

**I unequivocally agree** with this evaluation.  

Every detail it highlights—Blake as the sole possible thief, Blake as the only person inside at the alert moment, and the 10:29 Aria ACCESS DENIED line as the single unavoidable clincher—matches the locked-in timeline, sensor reconciliation, and occupancy tracking from the original solution with zero discrepancies.
