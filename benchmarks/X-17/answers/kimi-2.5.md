I'll solve this step-by-step, tracking who is inside the lab and reconciling all the evidence.

Step 1: Track Lab Occupancy Timeline

Time	Event	People Inside	
10:00	Lab empty, sample present	—	
10:05	Aria enters	Aria	
10:12	Aria exits	—	
10:14	Blake enters	Blake	
10:22	Chen enters	Blake, Chen	
10:26	Chen exits	Blake	
10:29	Aria denied entry	Blake	
10:33	Blake exits	—	

Step 2: Analyze the Critical Window (10:27–10:30)

The theft occurs between 10:27 and 10:30:15. Let's check who was inside:

- 10:27–10:26: Chen just left at 10:26, so only Blake is inside
- 10:29: Aria is denied entry — she never gets back in
- 10:29:40: Motion near locker (theft in progress)
- 10:29:42: Motion near door (false lead — explained below)
- 10:30:10: Locker opens
- 10:30:15: Alert triggers — sample missing

At 10:30:15, only Blake is physically inside the lab.

Step 3: Identify the False Lead

The 10:29:42 motion near the door is the false lead. This is 2 seconds after the locker motion (10:29:40), and occurs while Blake is alone inside. This could be:
- Blake moving toward the door after taking the sample
- A distraction or natural movement
- Unrelated to the actual theft mechanism

The critical motion is at 10:29:40 near the locker — this is when the theft occurs, and only Blake could have caused it.

Step 4: The Clincher Entry

The clincher is: `10:33 — Blake: EXIT`

Here's why this single entry is unavoidable proof:

1. At 10:29, Aria is denied entry — she never gets back inside
2. Chen exited at 10:26 — he's long gone
3. Therefore from 10:26 to 10:33, Blake is alone in the lab
4. The theft occurs at 10:29:40–10:30:15 — squarely in this window
5. Blake doesn't exit until 10:33 — meaning he was present for the entire theft sequence

Without the 10:33 Blake EXIT entry, we couldn't confirm Blake was still inside during the theft. He could theoretically have exited earlier (though the log shows no such entry). This entry confirms:
- Blake was inside during 10:29–10:30
- Blake is the only person who could have opened the locker
- Blake remained inside for 3+ minutes after the alert

Answers

1. Who took Sample X‑17? Blake — he was the sole occupant during the theft window.

2. At 10:30:15, who is inside? Only Blake — Aria was denied entry at 10:29, Chen left at 10:26.

3. The clincher: `10:33 — Blake: EXIT` — this confirms Blake remained inside throughout the entire theft sequence (10:29:40–10:30:15) and was the only person physically capable of accessing the locker when the sample disappeared.
