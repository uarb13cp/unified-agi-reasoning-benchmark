The Sealed Lab Sample Theft Puzzle (X-17) SolutionThis analysis systematically reconstructs the events within the sealed bio-lab to identify the individual responsible for the theft of Sample X-17, the lab's occupants at the time of the alert, and the critical piece of evidence that solidifies these conclusions.1. Reconstruction of Lab Occupancy TimelineBased on the complete door log from 10:00 to 10:40, and the assumption of no tailgating, the occupancy of the lab can be precisely tracked:Time RangeAriaBlakeChenOccupants Inside Lab10:00 - 10:05OutsideOutsideOutsideNone10:05 - 10:12INSIDEOutsideOutsideAria10:12 - 10:14OutsideOutsideOutsideNone10:14 - 10:22OutsideINSIDEOutsideBlake10:22 - 10:26OutsideINSIDEINSIDEBlake, Chen10:26 - 10:33OutsideINSIDEOutsideBlake10:33 - 10:40OutsideOutsideOutsideNone2. Reconciliation of Sensor and Inventory Data with OccupancyWe integrate the sensor and inventory logs with the established occupancy timeline to pinpoint the moment of theft and the responsible party.•10:00: Lab empty, Sample X-17 present in locker.•10:05 — 10:12: Aria is inside the lab. Her statement claims she
checked cultures and left, never opening the locker. This is consistent with the locker status at 10:27:00.•10:14 — 10:22: Blake is inside the lab. No locker access attempts are detected during this period.•10:22 — 10:26: Blake and Chen are inside the lab. Chen states he did a quick safety inspection. The locker status at 10:27:00 confirms no access attempts since 10:00.•10:26 — 10:33: Blake is the only person inside the lab.•10:27:00 — AUTO-CHECK: Sample X-17 present in locker. At this time, Blake is inside, and the sample is confirmed present.•10:27:00 — LOCKER STATUS: No access attempts detected since 10:00. This further confirms no one, including Aria or Chen, accessed the locker prior to this point.•10:28:00 — AUTO-CHECK: Sample X-17 present; no locker access attempts. Again, Blake is the sole occupant, and the sample is present.•10:29:40 — MOTION SENSOR: Movement detected near locker. Blake is the only person inside the lab at this time. This movement is attributed to Blake.•10:30:10 — LOCKER OPEN SENSOR: Locker door opened. Blake is the only person inside the lab. This directly implicates Blake in opening the locker.•10:30:15 — ALERT: Sample X-17 missing from locker. This alert occurs while Blake is still the sole occupant of the lab.3. Identifying the False Lead and the Clinching Log Entry•False Lead: The 10:29:42 — SECONDARY MOTION SENSOR: Movement detected near the door, not the locker is a false lead. At 10:29, Aria attempts re-entry and is denied. This movement near the door is consistent with Aria's attempted re-entry from outside the lab, not movement by someone inside the lab near the door. Blake is the only person inside at this time, and the primary motion sensor already detected movement near the locker at 10:29:40, which is attributed to Blake.•Clinching Log Entry: The door log entry that makes the answers unavoidable is: "10:33 — Blake: EXIT". This entry confirms that Blake was continuously inside the lab from 10:14 until 10:33. Combined with the inventory and motion sensor logs, which show the locker being opened and Sample X-17 going missing between 10:28:00 and 10:30:15, while Blake was the only person inside, it unequivocally points to Blake as the perpetrator. No other individual could have accessed the locker during this critical window.Conclusion1.Who took Sample X-17?
Blake took Sample X-17.2.At the moment the alert triggers (10:30:15), who is physically inside the lab?
Blake is physically inside the lab at 10:30:15.3.Which single door log entry, together with the stated assumptions and the sensor + inventory timestamps, makes your answers unavoidable?
The door log entry "10:33 — Blake: EXIT" is the clincher. It establishes Blake's continuous presence in the lab during the critical period when Sample X-17 went missing, making him the only possible individual to have accessed the locker and taken the sample.
