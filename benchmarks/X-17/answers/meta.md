Here is the step-by-step solution to the puzzle.

Step-by-Step Reasoning

Tracking Lab Occupancy: Let's track who is inside the lab based on the door log.
  10:00: The lab is empty.
  10:05–10:12: Aria is inside.
  10:12–10:14: The lab is empty.
  10:14–10:22: Blake is inside.
  10:22–10:26: Blake and Chen are inside.
  10:26–10:33: After Chen leaves at 10:26, only Blake remains inside the lab.
  10:33 onwards: Blake exits, leaving the lab empty again.

Focusing on the Crime's Timeframe: The critical events happen between 10:28 and 10:31.
  At 10:28:00, the sample is confirmed to be in the locker.
  From 10:26:00 to 10:33:00, the door log shows that Blake is the only person in the lab. No one else enters or exits.
  At 10:29:40, motion is detected near the locker. Since Blake is the only occupant, he must have caused this.
  At 10:30:10, the locker is opened. Again, only Blake could have done this.
  At 10:30:15, the sample is reported missing.

Identifying the False Lead: The motion sensor event at 10:29:42 near the door is a false lead. Aria's denied access at 10:29 might suggest she was lingering outside, but the sensor is inside the lab. Since Blake is the only person inside, he must have triggered it, perhaps by moving away from the locker area after the initial movement. It does not indicate a second person was present inside.

The Answers

1. Who took Sample X‑17?
Blake took the sample. The door log proves he was the only person with access to the lab between 10:28 (when the sample was last seen) and 10:30:15 (when it was reported missing). He was the only one who could have triggered the motion sensor and opened the locker.

2. At the moment the alert triggers (10:30:15), who is physically inside the lab?
Only Blake is inside the lab. Chen left at 10:26, and Blake does not exit until 10:33.

3. Which single door log entry makes your answers unavoidable?
The clincher is:
10:26 — Chen: EXIT

Why this is the clincher: This event marks the precise moment Blake is left completely alone in the lab. With Chen gone and no one else entering until Blake himself leaves at 10:33, every subsequent event inside the sealed lab—the motion near the locker, the locker opening, and the theft itself—can only be attributed to him. It isolates him as the sole suspect with absolute certainty.
