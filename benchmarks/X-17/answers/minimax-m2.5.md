I'll analyze this puzzle step by step to who stole Sample X determine-17 and answer all the questions.

Step-by-Step Analysis
Step 1: Track Who's Inside the Lab at Each Time Window
Based on the door log, let me track the occupancy:

Time	Event	People Inside
10:00	Start (verified empty)	0
10:05-10:12	Aria enters, exits	Aria
10:12-10:14	Empty	0
10:14-10:22	Blake enters	Blake
10:22-10:26	Blake + Chen inside	Blake, Chen
10:26	Chen exits	Blake
10:26-10:29	Blake alone in lab	Blake
10:29	Aria denied entry	Blake
10:30:15	Alert triggers	Blake
10:33	Blake exits	0
Step 2: Key Timeline Analysis
Critical events from sensors:

10:27:00 — Sample X-17 present, no locker access attempts
10:28:00 — Sample X-17 present, no locker access attempts
10:29:40 — MOTION SENSOR: Movement near locker
10:30:10 — LOCKER OPEN SENSOR: Locker opened
10:30:15 — ALERT: Sample X-17 missing
Step 3: Who Was Present When Sample Was Taken?
The sample went missing between 10:29:40 (motion near locker) and 10:30:15 (alert).

During this time window:

Blake was inside the lab (entered at 10:14, exited at 10:33)
Chen had already exited at 10:26
Aria was denied entry at 10:29
Conclusion: Blake was alone in the lab when the sample was taken.

Step 4: Analyzing the Secondary Motion Sensor
The secondary sensor at 10:29:42 detected movement near the door (not the locker). This seems contradictory, but let's examine why:

The sensor detected movement 2 seconds AFTER the motion near the locker (10:29:40)
No door events occur between 10:14 and 10:33 in the log
This is a false lead — the sensor may have been triggered by:
Air circulation from the ventilation system
The locker door opening causing air pressure changes
Sensor malfunction
This discrepancy actually supports our conclusion: it shows we cannot trust all sensor data equally, but the door log is stated to be "complete" and is therefore the authoritative source.

Answers
1. Who took Sample X-17?
Blake — He was the only person inside the lab during the critical window (10:29:40–10:30:15) when the motion sensor detected movement near the locker, the locker was opened, and the sample was confirmed missing.

2. Who is physically inside the lab at 10:30:15?
Blake — He entered at 10:14 and did not exit until 10:33. At the moment the alert triggers at 10:30:15, Blake is still inside the lab.

3. Which single door log entry is the clincher?
"10:33 — Blake: EXIT"

This entry is the clincher because:

1.
It confirms Blake was inside when the theft occurred (he exits at 10:33, but the sample went missing at 10:30:15)
2.
It eliminates all alternatives: Chen exited at 10:26 (too early), and Aria was denied entry at 10:29 (never got in)
3.
It creates the impossibility: Someone had to open the locker between 10:29:40 and 10:30:15, and the only person physically present was Blake
Without this exit time, we might wonder if someone else could have been inside. But the combination of:

Chen exiting at 10:26
Aria denied at 10:29
Blake still inside until 10:33
Proves definitively that Blake is the only person who could have taken the sample.

Final Verification
Let's check the statements against our conclusion:

Aria: "I checked my cultures and left. I never opened the sample locker."

✓ True — She was inside 10:05-10:12, before the sample was taken
Blake: "I was in there a while, but I didn't touch X-17."

✗ False — He was the only one there when it was taken
Chen: "I just did a quick safety inspection and made sure everything was secure."

✓ True — She was inside 10:22-10:26, left before the theft
Blake's statement is demonstrably false, confirming he is the culprit.
