**1. Who took Sample X-17?**
Blake took Sample X-17.

**2. At the moment the alert triggers (10:30:15), who is physically inside the lab?**
Blake is physically inside the lab at the moment the alert triggers.

**3. Which single door log entry, together with the stated assumptions and the sensor + inventory timestamps, makes your answers unavoidable?**
The clincher is the door log entry:
```
10:26 — Chen: EXIT
```
This entry is crucial because it confirms that Chen is no longer in the lab at the time of the motion near the locker (10:29:40) and when the locker was opened (10:30:10). This leaves Blake as the only person in the lab at those times, making him the one who took Sample X-17.

Thus, the entry "10:26 — Chen: EXIT" is the key piece of information that makes the conclusion unavoidable.

**Reasoning Summary:**
- At 10:29:40, motion is detected near the locker.
- At 10:30:10, the locker is opened, and at 10:30:15, Sample X-17 is reported missing.
- At these times, only Blake is in the lab because Chen exited at 10:26 and Aria was denied re-entry at 10:29 (but was already out since 10:12).
- Therefore, Blake is the only one who could have taken the sample.

The motion detected near the door at 10:29:42 is a false lead as it doesn't affect the conclusion that Blake was the one who took the sample.
