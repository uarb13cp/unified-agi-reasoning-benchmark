1. The only person who could have taken Sample X‑17 is **Blake**.[1]

2. At **10:30:15**, **Blake is inside the lab; Aria and Chen are both outside**.[1]

3. The clincher is the door log entry:  
   - **“10:33 — Blake: EXIT”**.[1]
   This proves Blake was continuously inside the lab from 10:14 until after the theft, while the others were not present when the locker was opened and the alarm triggered.

***

## Step 1 — Who is inside the lab, when?

Start with the door log and the assumption that all entry/exit must go through this one door, with no tailgating and a complete log from 10:00–10:40.[1]

- At **10:00**, lab is verified **empty**.[1]
- **10:05 — Aria: ENTRY**, **10:12 — Aria: EXIT** → Aria is inside from 10:05–10:12, then outside after 10:12.[1]
- **10:14 — Blake: ENTRY**, no exit yet → Blake is inside from 10:14 onward.[1]
- **10:22 — Chen: ENTRY**, **10:26 — Chen: EXIT** → Chen is inside from 10:22–10:26, then outside after 10:26.[1]
- **10:29 — Aria: ACCESS DENIED (attempted re‑entry)** → Aria is still outside at and after 10:29 because she never re‑enters.[1]
- **10:33 — Blake: EXIT** → Blake remains inside continuously from 10:14 up to 10:33.[1]

So at the critical times:  

- **10:27–10:28**:  
  - Inside: Blake.  
  - Outside: Aria (already exited), Chen (already exited).[1]
- **10:29–10:30**:  
  - Inside: Blake.  
  - Outside: Aria (denied), Chen (out since 10:26).[1]
- **10:30:10–10:30:15** (locker opens and alert fires):  
  - Inside: Blake.  
  - Outside: Aria and Chen.[1]

This already fixes the answer to Question 2: **only Blake is physically in the lab at 10:30:15**.[1]

***

## Step 2 — Aligning the sensors and inventory with the occupants

Locker/inventory timeline:[1]

- **10:27:00 — AUTO‑CHECK: Sample X‑17 present in locker**; **no locker access attempts since 10:00** → Up to this moment, nobody has opened the locker.[1]
- **10:28:00 — AUTO‑CHECK: Sample X‑17 present; no locker access attempts** → Still no locker opening, and the sample is still there.[1]
- **10:29:40 — MOTION SENSOR: Movement near locker** → Someone is near the locker at this time.[1]
- **10:29:42 — SECONDARY MOTION SENSOR: Movement near the door** → Motion at the door region 2 seconds later.[1]
- **10:30:10 — LOCKER OPEN SENSOR: Locker door opened**.[1]
- **10:30:15 — ALERT: Sample X‑17 missing from locker**.[1]

Combine this with who is inside:  

- At **10:27:00** and **10:28:00**, the sample is present and the locker has not been opened since 10:00, while **only Blake is inside**.[1]
- At **10:29:40** (motion at locker) and **10:29:42** (motion at door), the only person inside is still **Blake**.[1]
- At **10:30:10**, the locker opens; at **10:30:15**, the sample is detected missing, and the only possible physical actor in the lab is **Blake**.[1]

Therefore, the **locker was first opened at 10:30:10**, and the theft (removal of X‑17) occurs between **10:30:10 and 10:30:15**, with **only Blake present**.[1]

So **Blake’s statement “I didn’t touch X‑17” is false**.[1]
Aria’s and Chen’s statements can both be true:  
- Aria left at 10:12; both auto‑checks at 10:27 and 10:28 confirm X‑17 is still there, so she did not take it.[1]
- Chen exits at 10:26, again before the 10:27 and 10:28 confirmations that X‑17 is still present, so he did not take it.[1]

***

## Step 3 — Identifying the false lead in the motion events

There are two motion events very close together:[1]

- **10:29:40 — Motion near locker**  
- **10:29:42 — Motion near door**  

The **temptation** is to link the door‑area motion at 10:29:42 to someone entering or exiting, but the **door log shows no ENTRY or EXIT around 10:29**.[1]
The only relevant door activity near that time is **10:29 — Aria: ACCESS DENIED**, which is an outside badge attempt and does *not* open the door.[1]

Because:  

- All entry/exit must be logged.  
- There is no ENTRY/EXIT event at 10:29–10:30.  
- The lab is known to contain only Blake from 10:14 until his 10:33 exit.  

the **10:29:42 motion near the door must be a red herring** with respect to someone entering or leaving (e.g., Blake moving near the internal door area, environmental noise, etc.), not an additional person coming or going.[1]

The **real action** is:  

- Locker first opened at **10:30:10** → this is the first actual access to the locker after 10:00.[1]
- Sample missing by **10:30:15** while only Blake is inside.[1]

Thus the **false lead** is to over‑interpret the **10:29:42 door‑area motion event** as evidence of another person entering or exiting; the door log forbids that.[1]

***

## Step 4 — Why “10:33 — Blake: EXIT” is the decisive line

Many lines contribute, but you asked for the **single door log entry** that, together with the assumptions and timestamps, makes the answers unavoidable. That is:  

> **10:33 — Blake: EXIT**.[1]

Here’s why this one is the clincher:  

1. It shows that **Blake remained inside continuously from his 10:14 ENTRY until after the theft window (10:30:10–10:30:15)**, because there is no earlier EXIT for him.[1]
2. Given the assumption that the door log is complete and the only way in or out is through this door with no tailgating, this implies:  
   - At 10:27, 10:28, 10:29:40, 10:29:42, 10:30:10, and 10:30:15, **Blake must be inside**.[1]
3. All other people’s EXIT times precede the confirmed “sample still present” checks:  
   - Aria out at 10:12, well before 10:27 check.[1]
   - Chen out at 10:26, just before 10:27 check.[1]
   So they can be ruled out purely by timing once we know Blake is still inside later.  
4. The inventory system proves that the **first locker opening since 10:00** occurs at **10:30:10**, and the sample is missing by **10:30:15**.[1]
   With **10:33 — Blake: EXIT**, we know that the only person physically capable of opening that locker at 10:30:10 is Blake.  

You could try to cast doubt without that one line (for example, imagine Blake left earlier and re‑entered off‑log), but the explicit completeness of the log plus **his 10:33 EXIT** locks in the fact that **he never left before or during the theft**.[1]

So:  

1. **Blake took Sample X‑17.**  
2. **At 10:30:15, Blake is inside; Aria and Chen are outside.**  
3. The decisive door‑log line is **“10:33 — Blake: EXIT”**, because it forces the conclusion that Blake was the sole occupant during the only possible theft window, given the complete log and locker‑sensor timings.[1]
