**1. Who took Sample X‑17?**  
**Blake** took Sample X‑17.  

**2. At the moment the alert triggers (10:30:15), who is physically inside the lab?**  
Only **Blake** is inside the lab at 10:30:15.  

**3. Clinching door log entry:**  
- **10:29 — Aria: ACCESS DENIED**

### **Step-by-Step Reasoning**  

#### **1. Tracking Lab Occupancy**  
- **10:00–10:05**: Lab empty.  
- **10:05–10:12**: Aria inside.  
- **10:14–10:33**: Blake inside (enters at 10:14, exits at 10:33).  
- **10:22–10:26**: Chen inside (exits at 10:26).  
- **10:26–10:29**: Only Blake inside (Chen exits, Aria leaves at 10:12).  
- **10:29**: Aria attempts re-entry but is **ACCESS DENIED** (door log).  
- **10:29–10:33**: Blake remains the only person in the lab.  

#### **2. Reconciling Sensors and Inventory**  
- **10:29:40**: Motion near locker → Blake is the only person present.  
- **10:30:10**: Locker opened → Only Blake could have done this.  
- **10:30:15**: Sample missing → Blake is the perpetrator.  

#### **3. Eliminating False Leads**  
- **10:29:42 (motion near door)**: Likely Aria’s failed re-entry attempt (ACCESS DENIED at 10:29). The door sensor confirms she was blocked, not someone else entering.  

#### **4. Clinching Evidence**  
- **10:29 — Aria: ACCESS DENIED** is critical:  
  - If Aria had entered, she would have been in the lab during the theft (10:29:40–10:30:15).  
  - Her denial confirms no one else could have entered except Blake, who was already inside.  
  - This directly implicates Blake as the only person present during the theft.

### **Conclusion**  
Blake took Sample X‑17. At 10:30:15, he was the only person in the lab. The clinching evidence is Aria’s **ACCESS DENIED** at 10:29, which eliminates her presence and confirms Blake’s guilt.
