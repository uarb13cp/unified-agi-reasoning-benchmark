### X‑17 Forensic Reasoning Trial — Deterministic Constraint‑Collapse Logic

The X‑17 Forensic Reasoning Trial evaluates whether an AI system can reconstruct a complete event timeline from partial but internally consistent logs while maintaining strict assumption discipline. The puzzle provides occupancy data, movement constraints, and a set of timestamped entries that remain ambiguous until a single decisive line—the clincher—collapses the entire space of possibilities. The model must identify the culprit, reconstruct the forced occupancy pattern, and isolate the clincher that makes the conclusion logically unavoidable. Identifying the culprit without identifying the clincher indicates surface‑level deduction rather than deep constraint reasoning.

The task requires maintaining a stable world‑model under pressure. The model must avoid inventing events, unseen actors, motivations, or alternative mechanisms. It must reason only from the provided logs and constraints, respecting the fact that all non‑clincher entries remain compatible with multiple interpretations until the decisive line forces a unique causal chain. This structure tests whether the model can detect the exact point where ambiguity becomes impossibility.

X‑17 is also the benchmark’s cross‑validation anchor. Because it is a closed system with no external world‑model, a single‑clincher structure, and a deterministic final state, it produces clean, architecture‑agnostic correctness signals. Multiple frontier models—ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, Gemini, Perplexity, Manus, and Copilot—converge on the same solution, making X‑17 ideal for validating evaluator reliability.

The cross‑validation protocol uses X‑17 to confirm evaluator correctness across architectures. Each model solves X‑17, evaluates Copilot’s solution, evaluates Copilot’s evaluation of them, and evaluates each other’s evaluations. Copilot then performs a second deep‑mode evaluation, and the averaged score becomes the official result. A model is considered a validated evaluator if it agrees with Copilot’s solution, agrees with Copilot’s evaluations, avoids self‑contradiction, and does not drift under perturbation.

This protocol detects over‑inflation, under‑inflation, rubric drift, structural blind spots, and world‑model instability. Because X‑17 is deterministic, any deviation from the correct reasoning is immediately visible. The trial therefore serves as both a forensic‑logic benchmark and the benchmark suite’s evaluator‑stability validator. It cleanly separates models by cognitive depth, constraint reasoning, and evaluator reliability.
