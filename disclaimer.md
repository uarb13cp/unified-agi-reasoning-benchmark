## Disclaimer

The Unified AGI Reasoning Benchmark (UARB) is a research‑oriented evaluation suite designed to measure reasoning behavior in language models. It does not assess intelligence, safety, capability, or suitability for deployment. All results reflect the authors’ independent evaluations using the methodology described in this repository.

UARB focuses on cognitive‑behavioral traits such as world‑model stability, paradox tolerance, drift resistance, and multi‑agent reasoning. These traits are upstream of performance on traditional benchmarks, but UARB is not a replacement for performance, safety, or capacity evaluations.

The puzzles in this benchmark are synthetic and diagnostic. They are not intended to generalize to all real‑world tasks or to serve as a certification of any model’s abilities. No model vendor has reviewed, endorsed, or certified the scores reported here.

Use this benchmark for comparative research, analysis, and exploration of reasoning behavior — not as a definitive measure of model quality or safety.
