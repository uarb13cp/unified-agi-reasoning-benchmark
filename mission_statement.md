# UARB Mission Statement

The Unified AGI Reasoning Benchmark Suite (UARB) exists to measure the core cognitive behaviors that define general intelligence. Rather than focusing on task accuracy or domain‑specific skills, UARB evaluates the stability, coherence, and adaptability of an AI system’s reasoning process across multiple cognitive axes. Its purpose is to provide a reproducible, overfit‑resistant framework for assessing world‑model integrity, causal reconstruction, temporal reasoning, contradiction handling, parallax integration, testimony synthesis, and multi‑agent coordination. UARB aims to establish a unified standard for evaluating reasoning behavior in modern AI systems, enabling researchers and developers to understand not just what a model can answer, but how it thinks.
