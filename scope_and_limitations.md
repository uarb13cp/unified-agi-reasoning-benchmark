## Scope & Limitations

### Scope
The Unified AGI Reasoning Benchmark (UARB) evaluates **reasoning behavior** in language models.  
It focuses on cognitive‑behavioral traits that sit upstream of performance, including:

- world‑model stability  
- paradox tolerance  
- drift resistance  
- sequential reasoning integrity  
- multi‑agent reasoning  
- causal reconstruction  
- meta‑cognitive consistency  

UARB is designed to probe the *behavioral substrate* that produces reliable reasoning across domains.  
It complements — but does not replace — performance, safety, or capacity benchmarks.

### Limitations
UARB does **not** measure:

- intelligence  
- safety or alignment  
- factual knowledge  
- coding or mathematical skill  
- real‑world reliability  
- model suitability for deployment  

The puzzles in UARB are **synthetic, diagnostic stress‑tests**.  
They isolate reasoning behaviors under controlled conditions and may not generalize to all real‑world tasks.

All scores reported in this repository reflect the authors’ independent evaluations using the described methodology.  
No model vendor has reviewed, endorsed, or certified these results.

UARB should be used for **comparative research and analysis of reasoning behavior**, not as a comprehensive assessment of model quality, safety, or capability.
